The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board has begun pulling up its shark nets on smaller provincial beaches as Dineo moves from the Mozambican Channel closer to the South African east coast.While stressing that the tropical cyclone was not expected to cause any chaos with sea conditions the board s Mike Anderson-Reade said all precautions were being taken. The current and expected track of this weather system suggests that it should not have any serious effect on sea conditions off the KZN coastline. These systems often however are very unpredictable and may change direction. Cyclone Dineo is heading for us In order to minimise potential damage or losses to the shark safety gear the Sharks Board in consultation with coastal Municipalities will begin to remove shark safety gear at some of the smaller less popular bathing beaches. All major beaches will however remain open for bathing and any decisions on further gear removal if required will be made depending on the movement of the tropical storm he said. Deluge debris and Dineo: tropical cyclone batters Mozambique Most of the affected beaches are on the KZN north coast. Gear will be replaced as soon as the storm dissipates. Beach users are urged to check with lifeguards as to the status of the beach prior to entering the water said Anderson-Reade.
