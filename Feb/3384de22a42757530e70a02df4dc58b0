Mabuza and Khumalo were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment while Gwla was given 18 years.Mabuza and Khumalo told the court that Gumede made them believe that muti mixed with the body parts of a person with albinism would make them rich. In their confession the two told how they lured Mpunzi to her death using Gwala her boyfriend as bait.Gwala fetched Mpunzi from her home and took her to a secluded area where Mabuza and Khumalo were waiting. They strangled her.The next day her body was dismembered.
