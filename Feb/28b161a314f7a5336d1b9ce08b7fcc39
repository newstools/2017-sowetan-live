Whether they like it or not, Cape Town City cannot hide from the attention they are going get in the second half of the season.They'd rather go about their business silently, but their impressive performances under coach Eric Tinkler in the first round of the campaign would have certainly caught the eye of football lovers and their PSL rivals, who are probably going to plan to shut down the likes of Lebogang Manyama, Aubrey Ngoma and Lehlohonolo Majoro - some of the key men in attack.Level on points with Absa Premiership leaders SuperSport United (25), the Telkom Knockout champions have so far shown that they have what it takes to unsettle the title favourites. If taken lightly, they could just spring a surprise.But holding midfielder Mpho Matsi, who has been solid as protection for the back four, does not want City to get ahead of themselves and start thinking about winning the most coveted prize in local football. It's just important for them to pick up as many points as possible, starting with struggling Highlands Park at Cape Town Stadium tonight (7.30pm)."Our aim is not to concede many goals," said the former University of Pretoria player, before explaining what City have done right up to this point. "It's playing as a unit. We do everything as a team and with some of the individual brilliance from Manyama, Ngoma and many others, we compliment each other well. There's hunger as well."
