Jamaican sprint great Usain Bolt says he has no regrets about his decision to retire from athletics in 2017 as he has accomplished everything he wanted to in the sport.Bolt will hang up his spikes following the world championships in London in August, bringing the curtain down on a career that has delivered eight Olympic gold medals."I've just done everything I wanted to do in the sport," said Bolt who was voted the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year on Tuesday night."I asked (former US sprinter) Michael Johnson the same question, 'why did you retire when you were on top?' He said the same - he had done everything he had wanted to do in athletics so there was no reason to stay in the sport. Now I understand what he means."Bolt, 30, completed a "treble treble" of 100m, 200m and 4x100m Olympic titles at the 2016 Rio Games, but had his 2008 relay gold stripped last month after team mate Nesta Carter's re-tested sample contained a banned substance.Carter has said he will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.Meanwhile SA champion sprinter Wayde van Niekerk was beaten by German racing driver Nico Rosberg in a tight contest for the Breakthrough of the Year. - ReutersLAUREUS WINNERSSportsman of the Year: Usain BoltSportswoman of the Year: Simone BilesComeback of the Year: Michael PhelpsSportsperson of the Year with a Disability: Beatrice VioWorld Breakthrough of the Year: Nico RosbergWorld Action Sportsperson of the Year: Rachel AthertonWorld Team of the Year: Chicago CubsWorld Spirit of Sport: Leicester CitySport for Good: Waves of ChangeSporting Inspiration: Olympic Refugee TeamSporting Moment: Barcelona U12
