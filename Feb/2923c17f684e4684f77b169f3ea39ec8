When author and media personality Khaya Dlanga took to Twitter to praise the United Democratic Movement member of Parliament s cool performance at the otherwise heated state of the nation address his female followers weren t too interested in his politics.He tweeted a picture of the dapper bow-tied man saying: Kwankwa a real leader. A leader amongst leaders. #SONA2017 .Langa s mommy @nobantukumalo replied simply: @khayadlanga A super hot leader at that .Nkwankwa certainly got SkandaalZA?@SkandaalZA s vote: @khayadlanga He should be Pres...then we can watch SONA with dreamy eyes and believe all his promises ;-) Afrika Embo @afrikaembo noted that the politician s looks were not lost on his fellow MPs: @khayadlanga Observe how that lady in the background is looking at Nkwankwa.. Wiling to risk it all! #SONA2017 .Magangane ?@RyaGree001 said there was more to the man than what meets the eye: @gumede783 @NtombiCrystal @khayadlanga google this guy amazing story of overcoming hardship and making a difference .Nkwankwa grew up poor in the Eastern Cape before moving to Cape Town where he reportedly lived in a rubbish tip.
