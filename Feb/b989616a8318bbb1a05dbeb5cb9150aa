Thanda Royal Zulu coach Roger Sikhakhane has downplayed talk that his team have already gained promotion to the Absa Premiership after their 2-2 draw against AmaZulu at Umhlathuze Sports Complex at the weekend.Mhlengi Cele scored a brace for Thanda but Usuthu fought back to force a draw in the KZN derby with goals from Tapelo Nyongo and Siyabonga Nomvethe.The stalemate saw Amabhubesi's 12-point lead at the top being reduced to 10 after second-placed Black Leopards beat Mbombela United 2-1.Sikhakhane believes there is still a long way to go."It is still early to say that we have won promotion. I hear people talking and I see that as their way of trying to derail our progress."There are still 12 games left so we must wait and see," the former Chippa United coach said."I have to make sure the players remain disciplined and grounded because those premature claims can really affect our goals."We will try to win all our remaining matches and we will see after that."Meanwhile, Royal Eagles fought from 2-1 down to eventually defeat 10-man Mthatha Bucks 3-2.Sedwyn George bagged his third hat-trick of the season.The 25-year-old striker is now the NFD's top-goal-scorer with 17 goals to his name.The win helped third-placed Eagles to shoot up to a play-off spot.Elsewhere, a late strike by Siphesihle Nzimande handed strugglers Real Kings a 1-0 win over Jomo Cosmos.
