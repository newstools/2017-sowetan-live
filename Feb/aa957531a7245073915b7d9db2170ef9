After working with him at Djurgardens in Sweden 12 years ago, Siyabonga Nomvethe has come out in praise of new Orlando Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret.The 39-year-old AmaZulu star striker is one of a handful South Africans who have had previous direct involvement with the newly appointed Pirates mentor before he was paraded at the club's media conference at Rand Stadium on Monday."I know Jonevret very well," said Nomvethe, who has scored 11 goals for Usuthu in the NFD this season."He is a very professional man. He communicates with his players habitually. He is committed to maintain a healthy working relationship with his players. I remember one day, he told me that I should not forget to defend because he believes his attacking players must also track back. Bucs players must expect a friendly hard-working guy."The former Bafana striker added: "I trust that he will win titles and positively contribute to our football with his great deal of knowledge. Supporters should give him a chance because it is his first time coaching in Africa. His competence will assist him a lot."Another advantage for him is that he is articulate in English, which will be easy for him to liaise with players. Djurgardens are giants in Sweden with as rich a history as Pirates, and they win titles, so the coach is familiar with working at big teams."Nomvethe joined the 54-year-old's revolution at Djurgardens on loan from Italian club Empoli in 2005. But Bhele had a torrid stint under Jonevret, making just five appearances and registering only a single goal.Jonevret won the Swedish Premiership and a domestic cup in 2005, which led to him being named manager of the year that season.
