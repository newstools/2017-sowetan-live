The Dolphins could overtake log-leaders Titans at the top of the Momentum One Day Cup if they beat the unpredictable Knights at the Mangaung Oval in Bloemfontein on Wednesday.They hit the road to Bloemfontein following a three wicket defeat to the Cobras last weekend in Pietermaritzburg where a century by veteran wicket-keeper/batsman Morn van Wyk was in vain on Sunday.Looking back at the Cobras defeat Dolphins coach Grant Morgan said defeat to the Cobras was a blow but the tournament is a marathon and his charges are still on track with a month left of the competition. There were positives from all aspects of the game on Sunday but there were also a few little negative things " Morgan said."I think each and every guy knows that they could have contributed a tiny bit to our batting innings but I am not going to blame anyone."It is a collective thing and I think if each player could have found an extra run or two then those 22 runs would have made the difference. In the Knights the Dolphins are up against a side that is also reeling from defeat after they lost to the Warriors by 64 runs in Kimberley last weekend.None of their batsmen managed to score a half century in Kimberley as they failed to chase down a modest 189 target.Morgan will take confidence from the fact that he travels with the tournament s in-form bowler in Rob Frlyinck who is the leading wicket taker with eight and Van Wyk who is sitting on fifth place on the overall batting averages with 180 runs both after three innings. We back every player in this side to do a good job and on Sunday Khaya Zondo and Morn (Van Wyk) batted until the 45th over."No team is not going to send in Rob Frylinck in a situation like that and also Calvin Savage hit the ball out of the ground against the Lions."We have tried to create role definitions where certain decisions are made for specific reasons and I think that the guys have bought into that."Knights coach Nicky Boje will pin his hopes with the bat on Theunis de Bruyn and Pite van Biljon.Both have been impressive for them so far while Marchant de Lange and Dillon du Preez will lead the bowling attack.With the tournament reaching the half way mark Morgan believes that getting into a position of strength early is paramount for his men. Any time you can set something up earlier rather than later is a bonus and I use the example of a trip from Cape Town to Johannesburg."If I plan my journey well I make sure I know where I am going to stop and put petrol in and where I am going to eat."So hopefully all the puzzle pieces fall into place and by the time you are nearing your destination you hope to be in a position where you can just cruise in and not leave too much to do at the end. - TMG Digital
