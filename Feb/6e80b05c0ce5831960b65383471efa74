In Luther Singh, South Africa have discovered a star that could be as big as Benni McCarthy, Steven Pienaar and Lucas Radebe.The Portugal-based Singh inspired Amajita to a 3-1 victory with a phenomenal hat-trick in their opening Under-20 Afcon Group B match against Cameroon in Ndola, Zambia, yesterday.Amajita had to come from behind to secure the victory which puts them top of the group after Senegal and Sudan played to a 1-1 draw.Singh was the star when Amajita reached the Cosafa Cup final in December and the early signs are that he'll be the man coach Thabo Senong relies on to lead the team to World Cup qualification.Cameroon made a brighter start, first forcing a save out of Mondli Mpoto from a Kalvin Ketu Jih header before they took the lead through Eric Ayuk. Ayuk leaped above unsuspecting Notha Ngcobo to get his head on to a good cross whipped into the area.The lead lasted only 90 seconds, as the Singh show began at Levy Mwanawasa Stadium. His freekick hit the back of the net, but the Cameroon keeper should have fisted away.Singh put Amajita in front for the first time from the penalty spot after Sibongakonke Mbatha was brought down in the box just before the half-hour mark.The 19-year-old produced a moment of brilliance on the counter to complete his hat-trick, calmly rounding the opposition goalkeeper and then cutting back to his right foot to eliminate a defender, before finishing.More good news is that Bidvest Wits' Phakamani Mahlambi is expected to join the team for their second match against Senegal on Thursday (6pm).
