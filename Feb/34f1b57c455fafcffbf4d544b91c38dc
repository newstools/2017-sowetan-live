Sharks flank Keegan Daniel suffered what looked like a serious arm or shoulder injury in a pre-season warm-up game against the Cheetahs in Umlazi on Friday.Daniel a former Springbok flank left the field just before halftime in some distress but it unclear at this stage what the extent of the injury is.The Sharks won a typically scrappy early season encounter by 35-7 to hand the Cheetahs their second heavy loss in eight days after they lost 43-7 to the Stormers last week.The Cheetahs failed to capitalise on numerical superiority with three Sharks players No 8 Phillip van der Walt Daniel and lock Ruan Botha receiving yellow cards for dangerous play and repeated infringements during the match.Cheetahs coach Franco Smith was unconcerned about the score last week. He had chosen a callow team and the outcome was understandable. But Friday s loss to the Sharks saw the Cheetahs field a near full strength team. Smith might have deeper furrows in his brow this week.The Cheetahs started well enough crafting several half chances before centre Nico Lee went over for the opening try of the match midway through the first half.The Sharks drew level just before the break when a lean looking Coenie Oosthuizen powered over from close range and Pat Lambie converted to make it 7-7 going into the break.After halftime wing Kobus van Wyk scored the Sharks second and on the hour mark former SA Under-20 captain Jeremy Ward powered his way over for his first try in Sharks colours.Scrumhalf Cobus Reinach who looked lively after a long knee injury lay-off last year scored the Shark s fourth try and added a fifth from replacement Jean Droste to end the rout.Scorers:Sharks:Tries: Coenie Oosthuizen Kobus van Wyk Jeremy Ward Cobus Reinach Jean DrosteConversions: Pat Lambie (3) Benhard Janse van Rensburg (2).Cheetahs:Try: Nico LeeConversions: Niel Marais TMG Digital
