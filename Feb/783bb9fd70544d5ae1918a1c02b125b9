A Pretoria woman's dream of owning a swimming school is on hold.According to Refilwe Sebela, Penguin Pools Pretoria sabotaged her business plan. Sebela was a director at Ron Joy Swimming Academy but was retrenched in August.She thought of opening a swimming school. She also negotiated with the principal of a nearby school to send pupils to her.Sebela approached Penguin Pools who quoted her R80000 for an 8m by 4m pool. She managed to negotiate the price down to R75000.Sebela transferred the money immediately because Penguin Pools wanted full payment before they commenced work.She said she made it clear to Penguin Pools that she would be starting a swimming academy and intended running the business from January."They only went as far as digging the pool before abandoning the job," Sebela said.She said she had been given the run-around since December while the unfinished pool has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes.Sebela said each time she called Penguin Pools, she was given excuses about the weather. She said she approached Penguin Pools because they had been 60 years in the industry."They have now become arrogant and treat me like I owe them," Sebela said.Last Thursday, Sebela went to Penguin Pools in the company of police but was told she needed to secure an appointment before her complaint could be addressed.Jan-Pierre du Plessis, of Penguin Pools, said they could not complete Sebela's pool because she changed the terms of the contract by adding paving which she did not pay for. She disputed this and said paving was included in the initial quotation.Vincent de Klerk, owner of Penguin Pools, however, said they stopped when they encountered problems with water. De Klerk said Sebela had a restriction on her water supply that hindered their progress. So Penguin Pools brought in 2500l of water in drums to complete the application of gunite."Due to the rainfall, we could not complete it in December as this would have damaged the marbelite," De Klerk said."We are awaiting her response on when we can proceed and that all false accusations against Penguin Pools are withdrawn."Myrtle Kaadri of the National Spa and Pool Institute of South Africa (NSPI), said Penguin Pools Pretoria was not one of their members.She said they had been inundated with similar complaints which her office had forwarded to the people who are helping Penguin Pools with a business rescue.De Klerk confirmed his company went in to voluntary business rescue and said there was "no law stopping that". "We do not belong the NSPI as there is no need to as Penguin Pools has their own institute."
