Investigations are under way to establish whether Eskom staff colluded with suppliers to inflate their agreed rates with the parastatal.This week an employee from the Western Cape was arrested in connection with the scam and Eskom spokesman Khulu Pasiwe said more arrests are expected.The employee allegedly colluded with suppliers to inflate their hourly rates. The overpayment would then be shared equally between the employee and the relevant supplier.But one supplier blew the whistle on the scam after he was approached to participate. Zuma starts with the good news: growth to nearly treble Our suspicion at this stage is that it is not possible that this person (employee) was working alone said Pasiwe.He also said the scam might not be limited to the Western Cape.The tip-off sparked an internal investigation and later the Hawks and the SAPS were notified.Pasiwe said investigators are trying to establish how widespread it is and how long they have been operating.Suppliers could also be held accountable. Depending on what the findings are the suppliers risk losing their contract said Pasiwe who added that the investigation is at a sensitive stage. TMG Digital
