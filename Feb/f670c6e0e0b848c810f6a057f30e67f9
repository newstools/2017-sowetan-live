Ghana remain hopeful that captain Asamoah Gyan will be able to play a part in Thursday s Africa Cup of Nations semi-final against Cameroon. Our doctors have been working on him and gradually he is picking up, Ghana assistant coach Maxwell Konadu told reporters in Franceville on Wednesday. We can t confirm at the moment whether he is going to play or not but he was able to jog and do some small ball work yesterday so hopefully, but we will just have to wait and see what happens. Gyan, 31, came off in the first half of the 1-0 defeat to Egypt in Ghana s final group game a week ago with a groin injury and missed the 2-1 quarter-final victory over DR Congo as a result.
