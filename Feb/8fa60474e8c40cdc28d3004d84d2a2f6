Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda has called for calm in the wake of two family slayings in Matimatolo near Greytown and Richmond at the weekend. In the former three members of the Mkhize family were gunned down. Within hours of the attack four members of the same family including a seven-year-old girl were slain in Richmond. The area is well-known for political violence and faction fighting. Speaking to the media in Richmond Kaunda said that the police should be given space to investigate the murders. We have limited information at this point obviously with the understanding that the investigation is still ongoing. We do have some leads and we are hoping that they will yield positive results he said. Near Greytown we lost three members of the Mkhize family and here [in Richmond] we lost four members of the same family. Kaunda said that the area had a dark history of political violence and unrest but had been stable . This area is well-known for violence but right now it is stable that is why the news of this massacre shocked us. We want police to be visible in these areas and we want them to secure these communities and allay their fears he said.
