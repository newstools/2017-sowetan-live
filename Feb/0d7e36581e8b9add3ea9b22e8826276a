She had moved to the area from Eldorado Park following a tragedy.

"I'm excited, happy and give grace to God that she is at school," she said.Meanwhile, the department yesterday said it has reduced the number of pupils who had applied through the online application system for grades 1 and 8 but there were still 377 who were not placed in schools.
