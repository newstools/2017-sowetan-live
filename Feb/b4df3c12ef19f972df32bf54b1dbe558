The SA Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) says it is not opposed to the integration of city entities back under the control of the council of Johannesburg.The union is however unhappy with the process in which the decision was taken.Samwu spokesperson Papikie Mohale TMG Digital clarified the position of the union on the reintegration of Pikitiup Joburg Water and City Power. What we are not happy with is the deliberate miscommunication on the part of the mayor. The mayor said we are opposed to the move but we have never said so said Mohale. As a trade union part of our pillars is ensuring that municipal services are delivered directly by the municipality. We are against any form of privatisation of municipal services. This is part of our founding resolutions and standing resolution with which we operate till today. The only bone that we had with the proposal is that there was no consultation with organised labour. Our stance is: nothing about us without us . Last month mayor Herman Mashaba put a proposal before council which would see Pikitup Joburg Water and City Power being reintegrated under the direct control of the city.Currently the city is a shareholder of these entities and they operate under the Companies Act making them semi-autonomous of the city he argued.
