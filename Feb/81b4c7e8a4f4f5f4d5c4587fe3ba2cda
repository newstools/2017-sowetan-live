South Africans are fast getting over their cyber anxiety as more and more are choosing to ditch cash and queues for online shopping.In the past 12 months South Africans spent an estimated R37.1-billion for goods on the internet. And that number was expected to grow to R53-billion by 2018.The figures are from the 3rd annual global report on cross-border trade compiled by digital payment platform PayPal and market research giant Ipsos released on Monday.In the report which investigates the domestic and cross-border shopping habits of more than 28 000 consumers in 32 countries 58% of adults in SA with access to the internet were said to have shopped online in the last year.Most were spending their money on downloadable digital entertainment and education items event tickets clothing apparel and footwear. The South African commerce revolution is well underway and backed by the region s diverse and truly global population and high mobile penetration rates consumers are looking internationally to source their favourite products and services said Efi Dahan General Manager for PayPal Israel and Africa.But a large portion of the spend was leaving the country s shores with the US China and the UK cited as the most popular cross-border online shopping destinations.An estimated R8.8-billion went to these and other countries from the pockets of about 1.4 million South African online shoppers.One of the main reasons people bought from other countries the report said was free shipping secure methods of payment as well as access to products they could not find locally.There was also a 65% increase in mobile spend between 2015-2016 driven largely by the high mobile penetration in SA.The report was released ahead of the eCommerce Africa Conference taking place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre later this week.
