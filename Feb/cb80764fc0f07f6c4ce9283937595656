The case against the one of the two accused of the Sakhumzi Restaurant murder has been postponed to next week to allow the State more time to investigate. Njabulo Ngubane 24 from Dube Hostel Soweto was arrested in KwaZulu Natal over the weekend in connection with the murder of the famous eatery s manager Kwesi Hudson.He appeared at the Orlando Magistrate s court on Wednesday afternoon where the state asked that he be kept in custody at the Orlando police station holding cells until his next court appearance on 22 February. We have formally opposed bail because the charges that the accused faces fall under the schedule six category. Bail will not be considered unless he brings a formal bail application before court. said prosecutor Nadine Franks.Ngubane 24 is charged with murder and robbery with aggravative circumstances.The second accused who cannot be named until he appears in court was implicated in another restaurant robbery last November.He was also arrested in KwaZulu Natal on a robbery aggravating matter and will appear at the same court on Thursday.Th second accused faces charges of armed robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm which might have been involved to the killing of Hudson last month.Hudson 60 was shot and killed during an armed robbery at the internationally recognized restaurant after he had informed them that business for the day had closed.He officially joined the restaurant in 2015 to help expand the business.
