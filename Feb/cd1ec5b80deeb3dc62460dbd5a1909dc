Jackson Mabokgwane's sending off in Orlando Pirates's 2-1 defeat to Bidvest Wits at Orlando Stadium on Wednesday means Bucs will face Cape Town City away tomorrow with Siyabonga Mpontshane as their only goalkeeper.Brighton Mhlongo remains a doubt, so defender Happy Jele, who had to fill in in goal on Wednesday because Bucs had made all their substitutions, will have to be ready in case he is called upon.The game is the last before Pirates announce a new coach and whoever takes over will get all the support he needs from the players, according to Jele.The defender, who sometimes plays as a goalkeeper in training, was also quick to dismiss the perception that there were divisions in the team.After their 6-0 mauling by Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Stadium on Saturday, the Buccaneers were a much better side despite the midweek defeat.Jele pulled one back in the second period after Gabadinho Mhango's brace gave Wits a comfortable lead at the break but the long-serving defender's night ended with him in goal.The Pirates players went to the far side of the stadium at full time to acknowledge their supporters ."There are no divisions in the team. We are united and we are working harder everyday. When the new coach comes we need to support him," said Jele.l Pirates, meanwhile, announced yesterday they had parted ways with Ghana defender Edwin Gyimah."Gyimah had submitted a request in writing prior to his departure to the African Cup of Nations."The club has acceded to the request," Pirates said in a statement.
