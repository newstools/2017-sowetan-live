For the third year in a row South African MPs have secured a prominent mention on a blog that monitors the top parliamentary brawls on the planet.The blog posted footage of parliamentary security personnel ejecting vociferously rebellious Economic Freedom Fighters from Parliament on Thursday.While the punching swearing and name-calling will no doubt damage the country s reputation South Africa is not alone when it comes to chaotic scenes in parliament.Take Kosovo for example where the prime minister was pelted with eggs. Rotten eggs rain down on parliamentarians along with smoke bombs and bare-fisted blows in the Ukraine. It may look like chaos and anarchy but for some in Ukraine s political circles it is in fact democracy in action according to one report aired on local television.Here is just a sample of how politicians settle their differences in other parts of the world.1. In Kosovo the prime minister was pelted with eggs in 2015: 2. In 2010 Graciela Camano used force to shut her colleague up in the Argentinian parliament: 3. .
