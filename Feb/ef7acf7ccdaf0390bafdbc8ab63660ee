Platinum Stars coach Cavin Johnson says his players are fully focused to compete locally and on the continental stage.Dikwena are struggling in 12th place on the Absa Premiership standings and travel to fellow strugglers Baroka at Peter Mokaba Stadium tonight (7.30pm).It does not get easier for the North West-based side because they are also competing in the CAF Confederation Cup.They beat Mozambican side Uniao Do Songo 1-0 in the first leg of their preliminary round tie in Rustenburg on Saturday.Without much rest, they have to face Baroka in Polokwane and then travel to Mozambique for the second leg of the second-tier continental club competition this coming weekend.Johnson told Sowetan yesterday that there are advantages to playing games one after another."It is better because there is no time for parties, which is good for SA footballers."They stay focused all the time and the only bad thing about it is that [as a player] you don't get time for yourself. They have been on their toes in the last three weeks," said Johnson.Stars lost their home tie against Baroka 1-0 in September, but Johnson maintained that his players were focused on the job at hand to come away with victory this time."We will try our best. It is a major fight. They say it is harder at the top, but it is even harder at the bottom," he said."Our problem is that we didn't collect enough [points] last year, so we have to make sure we concentrate."Stars will be missing midfielder Solomon Mathe through suspension, while defender Siphiwe Mnguni remains on the sidelines because of injury.The last time Baroka won a match was, ironically against Platinum Stars, whom they beat 3-1 in the Telkom Knockout on October 23.Baroka have since gone 11 matches without a win in all competitions, but victory over Stars will make it three out of three against Johnson's men this season.
