Burkina Faso are seeking to repeat the heroics of four years ago when they got to the deciding match at FNB Stadium while Egypt have made much quicker progress after a lengthy exile from the top of the African football tree.It is likely to be an evenly balanced semifinal at Stade l Amitie pitting the attacking style of the Burkinabe against a solid Egyptian defence that has yet to concede a goal in the tournament in Gabon.The centreback pairing of Ali Gabr and Ahmed Hegazy have been unsung heroes of the tournament rarely making a mistake as Egypt topped their first round group including beating Ghana then edging past Morocco albeit not having had the lion s share of chances.Burkina Faso also surprised in finishing top of Group A ahead of Cameroon and ousting hosts Gabon.Coach Paulo Duarte and his players are fixed on a return to the final after their surprise run in 2013. Obviously this time we want to go one better said the coach on Tuesday at the pre-match press conference.It was a sentiment echoed by experienced centreback Bakary Kone formerly of Olympique Lyonnais and now with Malaga in Spain. Our objective is to play the final. We just want to get to this match he said.But Egypt will be a tough nut to crack. Besides their rock-solid defence they have gotten stronger on attack too and showed against Morocco that if given a half-chance they will invariably take it. We have a very good group of players with technical skills with personality and with humility. I have confidence in my team they are very talented and they have the right spirit too said Egypt coach Hector Cuper.The Argentine has revitalised the Pharaohs after they missed out on three successive tournaments and has also placed them in a strong position for the next World Cup.Mohamed Salah remains dangerous particularly on the counter-attack and with set pieces.For Burkina their attacking spear will be Bertrand Traore who hangs wide on the right but can cut in with devastating effect.Both sides have injury concerns going into the game as Burkina Faso play without Jonathan Pitroipa voted best player of the 2013 tournament and Egypt must do without Arsenal midfielder Mohamed Elneny. - TMG Digital
