City and provincial organised business welcomed her plan as a bold step towards changing the economic fortunes of the metro.Gumede launched her plan during the radical economic transformation business summit at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Convention Centre in Durban on Wednesday saying a new era of doing business in eThekwini would ensure fairness and transparency. Gumede said her team had ensured the plan was in line with constitutional requirements for municipalities developing local economies.Gumede said every project with a contract value between R5-million and R30-million would have to set aside 30% of the project for subcontractors. Subcontractors or service providers shall be selected from the wards where the service or project is being undertaken. If the project was across a number of wards opportunities would be granted to subcontractors in all the benefiting wards said Gumede.She said subcontractors would be appointed by the main contractor from a database provided by the municipality at the tender stage or be nominated by the municipality after a thorough screening processing that ensures objectivity fairness and transparency . The main contractor or service provider would expected to provide training for subcontractors. The training and coaching should enable the subcontractor to apply for higher Construction Industry Development Board grading after the completion of the project or registry with the appropriate professional or monitoring body Gumede said.Gumede said small businesses should participate in every sector of the economy and questioned why contracts that did not need technical skills like waste collection grass cutting and storm drainage maintenance still went to established contractors.She said the supply chain management would keep a database for ward-based contractors or service providers and should be renewed annually.
