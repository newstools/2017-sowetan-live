Perhaps someone has been putting some Guarana in their Christmas pudding?The Premier Soccer League returned from its six-week break for the festive period and the Africa Cup of Nations this week not with a bang but an A-bomb with 25 goals scored in eight matches.There was just one goalless draw between Platinum Stars and Orlando Pirates in Rustenburg on Wednesday night.The highest-scoring match was between SuperSport United and Lamontville Golden Arrows at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville on the same night where Matsatsantsa ran out 5-2 winners.Remarkably all seven goals were scored in a frenetic second half at a breathtaking rate of one strike every six-and-a-half minutes.SuperSport coach Stuart Baxter said afterwards his side had needed a big win to regain the lead that was snatched from them for 24 hours by Bidvest Wits who had stunned Ajax Cape Town on form before the recess 5-0 at Bidvest Stadium the previous night.Kaizer Chiefs 3-1 win against Free State Stars had four goals in it.New franchise Cape Town City s fairytale first-season run in third place appears set to continue into 2017 as they began the year with a 3-0 stopping of Highlands Park.The PSL matches this week averaged 3 125 goals per game.
