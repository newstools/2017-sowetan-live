A Limpopo pensioner had to tell his granddaughter to try and memorise lessons in class because he could not afford to buy her stationery.Yesterday, William Makena from GaMakena village near Jane Furse said the local school where five of his grandchildren attend had not received stationery this year.The provincial department of education had said stationery would be delivered to all schools by the end of January after some delays in its systems.The nondelivery has resulted in a public outcry, with some civil rights organisations, including the SA Human Rights Commission, speaking out against the department for violating the education rights of children.Makena, the village headman, said he could only afford to buy books for his four other grandchildren who are in lower grades.School book delivery on right track - Limpopo premier "I told the eldest who is in Grade 7 to listen attentively in class and try to remember what was being taught because there is nothing for her to write on," Makena said.He said other parents were also frustrated over the lack of stationery.Chairwoman of the school governing body Mapula Mokoala said they called a meeting and asked parents to buy stationery but most parents could not afford to do so."Not all learners were covered because we live in a deep rural area and unemployment here is very high."Teachers are continuing with lessons but kids are affected because they have nowhere to write. We are all frustrated," Mokoala said.Mokoala said the school had only received deliveries of workbooks. She said they had reported the matter to the department's circuit office but nothing was being done.Mokoala said the school, which has 346 pupils, had other issues including overcrowding, while the pit toilets were in a bad condition.Department spokesman Naledzani Rasila said they were aware that some schools had not received stationery or had received less than what was required.Rasila said this was caused by the unanticipated increase in the number of pupils in those schools and failure by some principals to report shortages. He said there were also issues with the suppliers.Rasila urged principals to report the shortfalls to their circuit offices immediately, adding that they can take the matter up at district level if they were not getting assistance.Spokesman for education rights group Basic Education for All Tebogo Sephakgamela said they were disappointed with the stationery issue."We have lost hope in the Limpopo education department. It seems they are not taking our children's education seriously," Sephakgamela said.mahopoz@sowetan.co.za
