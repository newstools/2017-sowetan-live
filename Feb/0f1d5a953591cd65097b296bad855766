A well-rested Mamelodi Sundowns will play their first competitive match without departed Keagan Dolly today, but it seems his absence will be felt more in the dressing room than on the pitch.Themba Zwane, one of the players who can fill the void left by the now France-based Dolly, boasted about the quality Sundowns have in their squad to compete on all fronts. They are not likely to be affected by their former team mate's departure midway through the season, according to Zwane.As was the case last year, Sundowns have a tight schedule ahead, but they are well-rested to tackle what the Absa Premiership, CAF Champions League and Nedbank Cup have in store for them.There's also the CAF Super Cup against TP Mazembe later this month to think about.However, they have proven that they can get results against all odds."We are going to miss him [Dolly], but at Sundowns we have too much quality. Whoever plays, we can win," said Zwane ahead of Sundowns's league match against Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Molemela Stadium tonight (7.30pm)."We have had enough rest and are ready [for the tight schedule]."It's not going to be easy, but we have enough quality to play all these games."At the time of going to print, Sundowns were five games behind log leaders SuperSport United.Pitso Mosimane's men face a Celtic side they have beaten in their last four visits to Bloemfontein in the league.That, however, is no reason for Sundowns to think tonight's encounter will be a walk in the park."We know that it's going to be a tough game because Celtic are capable of causing problems on the counter attack. We have been watching videos of their last three matches and are ready," said Zwane.Sundowns have Anele Ngcongca available for selection after the former Genk defender recovered from a knee injury."It's a good feeling to have Anele [available]. We learn a lot from him and he guides us," said Zwane.
