Kaizer Chiefs will be looking for their fifth consecutive win when they host Highlands Park at Moses Mabhida Stadium tomorrow (6pm).Amakhosi's in-form midfielder George Maluleka believes the team is in the right frame of mind to continue the fine run in the Absa Premiership."I don't think much has changed, really. I just think we've been working on our mindset lately just to be positive," said Maluleka, who was voted man of the match in the last two games.Chiefs have been getting goals from midfielders of late, with Siphiwe Tshabalala and Willard Katsande among the scorers.But striker Bernard Parker has also been on the scoresheet."Maybe it is a reflection of our performances as a team," said coach Steve Komphela"We are getting goals from all phases; balls coming from centra [areas], wide [and] from set-pieces. And when you look at it, we have scored 23 goals and the highest scorers [SuperSport United and Mamelodi Sundowns] are on 26."Chiefs look a good bet to get more goals against 15th-placed Highlands Park, who have the worst defence in the league.
