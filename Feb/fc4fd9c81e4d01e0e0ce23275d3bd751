The African National Congress (ANC) recent announcement on land restitution without compensation proves that the Economic Freedom Fighters' (EFF) polices are right.This is according to EFF's spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi who was responding to Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform Gugile Nkwinti's comments that the Constitution should be amended to address the pressing issue of land without compensation.In his speech in Parliament during the debate of the State of the Nation Address, Nkwinti said that they will look into the issue but will make sure it's all in the confines of the Constitution. A pre-colonial audit of land ownership, use and occupation patterns must be done. Once the audit has been completed, a single law should be developed to address the issue of land restitution without compensation. The necessary constitutional amendments should be undertaken to effect this process, said Nkwinti.The EFF's Ndlozi said that this move vindicates his party's policies but also said the ANC could be using this to ensure they remain in power as they realise the land issue appeals to the masses."They realise the EFF is bringing the land debate to the public and they realise that we are winning that debate."As people who want to stay in power, they have to address issues that appeal to the public," he said.Ndlozi said that although it is obvious the ruling party is taking a bite out of their policies, what matters is that South Africans will benefit at the end of the day."It means we are right, the policies of the EFF appeal to the people. It doesn't matter who implements them as long as the people of South Africa benefits," said Ndlozi.Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane accused the ANC of being threatened by the EFF to a point where they follow their policies."Mr President, are you seriously so afraid of the EFF that you would follow their policies? You must in fact know that these policies will lead down the same failed path as Zimbabwe and Venezuela," said Maimane during the SONA debate.
