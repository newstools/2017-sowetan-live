Mamelodi Sundowns might have made life hard for themselves with the chances they missed, but in the end the Brazilians showed their class for a 2-1 victory against a fighting Platinum Stars that maintained their charge on the Absa Premiership title.Themba Zwane s 11th-minute strike gave Sundowns an early lead as they threatened to run away with the game in the first half, but missed scoring opportunities that came too easily.Almost inevitably youngster Sphamandla Mlilo headed Stars back into the game in the 49th minute. Downs kept their heads and Khama Billiat scored an 84th-minute winner.Sundowns have a look about them of a team that are just too good for the PSL right now. The African champions have cut their teeth at a higher level, come back, and appear to be just getting better.The addition of Algerian Fares Hachi and Bafana Bafana s 41-cap, 29-year-old Anele Ngcongca at left and right-back have only made Downs stronger, even if they have lost Keagan Dolly to Montpellier in France.Both started on Tuesday night. Hachi showed his class setting up Downs opener. Played down the flank by a one-two with Billiat, Hachi cut the ball back to find Themba Zwane alone, who timed a sharp side-foot past goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela.The chances seemed to come too easily from there for Downs, who in difficult, soggy conditions under foot on a soaked pitch appeared a little overly comfortable in finding a killer second.Hlompo Kekana won the ball in midfield and Lucky Mohomi put a pass through the middle for Percy Tau to be alone on goal to chip Mzimela, but inches wide.Tau got behind the defence and squared to Laffor, free in front of goal, who could not control.With Stars opened again Laffor just had to pick out Billiat with an angled pass, the Zimbabwean s attempt at a finish cleared off the line by Gerald Phiri.Stars did try to put together passing movements, but, while Downs could operate off the front foot, the North West side were always trying to attack off the back foot. Bonginkosi Ntuli fashioned space on the edge of the area in the 39th, but blasted high.With so many chances coming their way, Downs might have felt a second goal would come at some stage. Instead they were made to pay for their wastefulness when, within minutes of the break, Stars equalised.From a free-kick swung in by Vuyo Mere, young defender Mlilo got up for the touch-on with the header past Denis Onyango.Downs had been so dominant that it still seemed they should be able to find a winning goal, or more, in the 40 minutes that remained of the second half.But they made heavy work of it against a Stars who improved defensively.It took until the 70th minute for Thapelo Morena, on for Ngcongca at the break, to show his pace on the right and cross, Tau heading just over.Stars substitute Gift Links, on for Ndumiso Mabena, rifled a shot at the top-left corner that had Onyango at full stretch.As Downs entered the final 10 minutes they might have wondered if they had blown a victory. Their class showed when a Tau-Billiat one-two saw the latter on goal, and the Downs forward rolled a finish past Mzimela.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
