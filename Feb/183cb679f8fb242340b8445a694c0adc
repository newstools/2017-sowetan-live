It's crucial for Kaizer Chiefs to build on their three-match unbeaten run if they are not to blow their chances of winning the Absa Premiership title.Their 3-1 victory over Free State Stars was Amakhosi's third straight victory in the league but coach Steve Komphela will keep demanding more from his players to ensure they do not become complacent.Siphiwe Tshabalala, Bernard Parker and Willard Katsande found the back of the net as Amakhosi scored more than two goals in a game for only the third time this season."You feel the mood is better and our focus is different. We want to do better. We can never reach a comfort zone because the minute you become comfortable, you become complacent and mediocre. So we have to remain focused. What's important is to stay with the pack [at the top]. You can't afford to drop points at this stage," said Komphela."We are looking for consistent performances."Chiefs were comfortable throughout the match, taking a two-goal lead at half-time before sealing the tie with a third just after the hour mark. They conceded a soft goal, from a Rooi Mahamutsa free-kick 17 minutes from time. They took their foot off the pedal when they could have gone for more goals."After [scoring] two and three, we took the foot off the pedal. We did not play with the intensity we had in our previous two matches [against Polokwane City and Golden Arrows]. But we are delighted that we won the match." New striker Gustavo Paez made his debut.
