Lubabalo Tera Mtembu has been out of the Sharks' Super Rugby team with various injuries for so long that he's forgotten how it feels to don a starting jersey. He'll be in his preferred number eight jersey for their campaign opener against the Reds in Brisbane on Friday but the bigger deal in regards with the match is Lwazi Mvovo's 100th Super Rugby cap.The 30-year-old from Mthatha will become the 34th South African to become a Super Rugby centurion and Mtembu is immensely proud of his team mate. To play a 100 caps on the wing is a huge milestone which is made even better because he was a late starter " Mtembu said."He's been very consistent for the Sharks over the years and what he's done is an amazing achievement."He's been a big influence in the team and on myself personally and I don't think he realises the influence he has and the energy he brings to the team. The bad luck of injuries I've had have made me realise and appreciate more the fact that I've been on the outside looking in."The injuries have made me realise how blessed I am to be playing this game and do what I love."I'm really excited to be playing again. The newly installed Sharks vice-captain will be part of an eight-nine-ten link that includes Springbok halfbacks Pat Lambie and Cobus Reinach.The former spent parts of the season out with injury while the latter had to look on from the stands and at home with a knee ligament injury that saw him miss the whole of last season.It will their first opportunity to stake a Bok claim while Reinach will finally have the chance to show why he should have gone to the 2015 Rugby World Cup.Former Southern Kings utility back Lukhanyo Am gets a start at outside centre while Sharks coach Robert du Preez has decided to persist with the bulky but limited Andre Esterhuizen at inside centre.Precocious talent Curwin Bosch will start at fullback while former French international Clement Poitrenaud will come off the bench.Mtembu is not the designated opensider but a tussle with the legendary George Smith is one he is looking forward to. The Reds have recruited well and they have Smith and Scott Higginbotham as well and those are seasoned internationals."It's going to be a tough challenge for us but we don't want to focus too much on individuals because we know what we want to achieve and we've been working hard towards that Mtembu said.Reds: 15 Karmichael Hunt 14 Chris Kuridrani 13 Samu Kerevi 12 Duncan Paia'aua 11 Eto Nabuli 10 Quade Cooper 9 Nick Frisby 8 Scott Higginbotham 7 George Smith 6 Adam Korczyk 5 Kane Douglas 4 Rob Simmons 3 Sam Talakai 2 Stephen Moore 1 James Slipper (captain).
