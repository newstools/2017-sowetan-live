New Orlando Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret has signed a three-year contract but if he sees out the term he will become only the second to last that long at the club.Pirates have had a steady churn of coaches since the launch of the Premier Soccer League in 1996 with Jonevret the 21st coach to sit on the Pirates bench in as many years.Only Ruud Krol has lasted three years with the last permanent coach Muhsin Ertugral at the clubs for just a matter of months.The Swede unknown in Africa but a league winner in Scandinavia also keeps up a long list of foreign appointments by the club who have only used six local coaches in the last two decades.Pirates have previously had nationals from Brazil the Democratic Republic of Congo France the Netherlands Nigeria Peru Romania Russia Serbia Turkey Zambia and Zimbabwe in charge.Krol s three full seasons from 2008 to 2011 remains the longest uninterrupted stint in charge of Pirates by any coach.He ended with the league and cup double but did not have his contract renewed.Since the Dutchman s departure Pirates have been through seven coaches.Jonevret is only the second Swede to coach in the PSL after Roger Palmgren who had stints at Thanda Royal Zulu and AmaZulu.Pirates coaches since the start of the PSL in 1996: Viktor BondarenkoAugusto PalaciosRonald Mkhandawire (caretaker)Shaibu AmoduViktor Bondarenko (second stint)Ted DumitruRonald Mkhandawire (caretaker)Gordon IgesundAugusto Palacios (second stint)Jean-Yves KerjeanRoy BarretoAugusto Palacios (third stint)Kosta PapicTeboho Moloi (caretaker)Milutin SredojevicKalambay MutomboOwen da GamaRuud KrolJulio Cesar LealAugusto Palacios (fourth stint)Roger de SaEric Tinkler (caretaker)Vladimir VermezovicEric Tinkler (caretaker then permanent)Muhsin ErtugralAugusto Palacios (five stint) - TMG Digital
