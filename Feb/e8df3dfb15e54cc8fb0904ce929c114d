The achievement of learners and teachers in national and international benchmark tests paints a very bleak picture one that highlights a national crisis the statement read. To address this need the Science Learning Centre for Africa in UWC s Faculty of Education has introduced a number of far-reaching support programmes to improve the teaching and learning of science and mathematics.
