After being terrorised to the point that it was just all too much for their fans by Mamelodi Sundowns big six on Saturday now Orlando Pirates face the rejuvenated Bidvest Wits pairing of James Keene and Phakamani Mahlambi on Wednesday night.Sundowns super-slick frontline of Percy Tau Khama Billiat Anthony Laffor and Themba Zwane surgically disemboweled a disheveled Bucs 6-0 at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday.The question in Wednesday night s Absa Premiership clash at Bucs home base at Orlando Stadium is whether Pirates will rebound or whether a side who have been alarmingly directionless will capitulate to another defeat against Gavin Hunt s aggressive organised Wits.The Clever Boys return from the six-week PSL break with a 5-0 thrashing of Ajax Cape Town last Tuesday where English journeyman professional Keene and SA s brightest striking prospect Mahlambi reunited after long-term injuries and created havoc does not bode well for Pirates. Not to mention Malawian pocket rocket playmaker Gabadinho Mhango who scored a brace to add to Mahlambi and Keen s goal apiece. We ve got James back and for me he should have been man-of-the-match [against Ajax instead of Mahlambi] Hunt said then. James was outstanding and he epitomises what we are all about. We missed him so he s important for us. The one [Mahlambi] doesn t work but uses his pace well and the other [Keene] works his socks off so it is a great combination. Pirates caretaker-coach Augusto Palacios the long-time servant and coaching fireman for the club took Saturday s 6-0 thrashing and the violent pitch invasion by Bucs fans personally and did not return to the field once the match resumed for the final eight minutes.With Pirates set to announce a new coach on Monday Palacios knows he will not continue into next week but will want to redeem his tenure with good results against Wits then current league leaders Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday night.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
