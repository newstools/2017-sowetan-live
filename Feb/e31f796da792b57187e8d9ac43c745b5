SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter has distanced himself from speculation that he could become the new Bafana Bafana coach.Baxter who coached Bafana from 2004 to 2005 has for the past few weeks been strongly linked with the national team job after the sacking of Shakes Mashaba in late December.Baxter however has laughed off the rumours as pure speculation and remains focused on the job at hand which is coaching the Absa Premiership's current top side. I m not too fazed by it to be honest with you Baxter said on Monday. There is speculation all the time and I mean I ve heard a story this week from a colleague in England that others are saying in the papers that I could be succeeding Carlos Queiroz in Iran. That s about as far from my thoughts as you can get but it is there. This is not the first time Baxter has been linked with a return to Bafana.During his time with Kaizer Chiefs between 2012 and 2015 the 63-year-old was thought to be interested in returning to the SA Football Association in a technical director role which never materialised. I don't know. People say things and maybe it is taken and blown up the coach said. I m not fazed about it because it is just a part of our game and it helps you guys [the media] write your articles; speculate a little bit more. There was a journalist in England who once said to me Yeah coach never let the truth get in the way of a good speculation . Asked if he would be interested if approached Baxter was non-committal. I don t want to fuel the speculation because I would say I ve been a national team coach and I ve been a club coach he said. There are attractions in both jobs but when you are the actual coach it is an honour wherever you are. When I was in Finland I was honoured to be the Finnish national coach. But to sort of throw my name in the ring for a job that is just pure speculation is out of order " Baxter added.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
