Olympian 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk would like to run a few 100s and 200s in South Africa while in training for the World Champions in August. If coach allows me I will do a few 200s but she does not like the 100s.

I m still a bit busy and coach is slowly but surely taking a few jabs at me that I need to slow down and get some consistency in my training Van Niekerk said. Training is always tough whether you have won a medal or not but I m putting in hard work to achieve as much as I can. I m building up towards the World Champs.
