Is new Kaizer Chiefs striker Gustavo Paez the real deal?This question pops up when one considers the little impact that the few South American-born players have made in a Chiefs jersey in recent years. But if you ask anyone at Naturena - from coach Steve Komphela to captain Itumeleng Khune - they vouched that Paez is the real deal.Such rave reviews will give Amakhosi faithful an impression that Paez, 26, pictured,will fare better than compatriot Jose Torrealba, the last South American Chiefs had on their books. Torrealba failed dismally, scoring a paltry eight goals in 51 matches for the Soweto giants during a three-year spell. He left Chiefs in 2011.Paez will, however, hope to make an impression for a Chiefs side that has not found a proven goal-poacher since the days of Collins Mbesuma and Knowledge Musona.Paez is confident that Amakhosi haven't made a mistake by signing him on a two-year-and-half deal."I'm very happy to be here and will try to do my best for the team."I want to be an important player for Chiefs," he told the media at Chiefs' village yesterday.Paez's record leaves a lot to be desired, though. He has managed a paltry 19 goals in 143 appearances since starting his career in 2006, having played for, among others, Spanish Segunda division outfit, Mallorca.But Komphela has appealed for patience as Paez settles into life as a Glamour Boy. "Gustavo could be one of the solutions and not the answer," appealed Komphela.Currently, PSL's sole South American import, Colombian Leonardo Castro, has already proved his worth at Mamelodi Sundowns.
