Cabinet Minister Nomvula Mokonyane has been forced to defend herself against assertions by the Chief Whip of the Economic Freedom Fighters Floyd Shivambu.A letter by the red berets contains what the minister s office calls an implied allegation that a certain individual with a close relationship with the Minister is influencing departmental programmes procurement processes and spending; and that the Minister is the owner of a certain property worth R40 million in the suburb of Sandhurst Johannesburg . The Minister has formally responded to the Chief Whip of the EFF and for public record wishes to state the individual referred to is neither in the employ of the department or any of its entities and as such is in no way involved in the operational and decision-making processes of the department. Equally the Minister has declared all her assets and interests including properties as required by the Register of Members Interests and owns no such a property. The letter published by the EFF on its website was dated 7 February 2017. It asked the minister bearing in the mind the requirements of the executive ethics act how many times she had visited the property in the past 12 months what funds were used to purchase it and whether she had a personal relationship with a man who allegedly approves payments on behalf of the department even though he is not employed by the department.The EFF also asked her whether her department was being taken to court for non-payment of contractors.On Twitter Shivambu charged: Minister of Water &amp; Sanitation has outsourced the ministry to a Ben 10 who she travelled with to Iran and New York last year .The water and sanitation ministry charged that the allegations are aimed at tarnishing her good name. The Minister rejects the allegations as unfounded without factual basis and refuses to be intimidated by such actions for the benefit of EFF financial and political interests and those whose financial fortunes they seek to bolster by such action. Meanwhile the EFF s leadership is preparing for tonight s State of the Nation address by President Jacob Zuma but its commander in chief Julius Malema also has academic obligations.Chairperson Dali Mpofu tweeted: Being EFF President is no easy job: University Exam on Wednesday... War on Thursday evening..Another exam on Friday morning! #GoodLuckCiC .
