Thabo James Dube, 37, appeared briefly in the Moretele Magistrate's Court - his third court appearance. The last time he appeared he had indicated that he did not want bail but yesterday he changed his mind.His matter was postponed to February 21 for a formal bail application.According to police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele, when Dube was arrested he confessed to killing his live-in lover Itumeleng Elizabeth Molefe, 37, who was also the mother of his two-year-old daughter.During his first appearance in the Moretele Magistrate's Court, Dube also confessed before the magistrate.Makhubele said Dube cooperated fully with the police and revealed where he had buried Molefe's charred remains.Dube was arrested on January 21 after he handed himself over to Temba police in Hammanskraal, outside Pretoria.Molefe, who had two other children aged 12 and nine from a previous relationship, was last seen alive on October 6 last year in Stinkwater, Hammanskraal, and was reported missing at the local police station on October 26.Her cousin Lophisa Cook pleaded with the court not to grant Dube bail."We are angry and can't believe what he did to our sister. He committed a brutal offence. He is brutal."She said she feared that should the court grant him bail, he would evade trial."I don't trust that he will stand trial. He is facing serious charges and we want him to rot in jail. We don't want to see him in our community again."Cook said even if Dube had asked for forgiveness from the family, they would not forgive him."We trusted him. They were a happy couple. We took him as our brother. He has hurt us and we want him to face the law."A group of members of the ANC Women's League protested outside the court building.Tshwane regional chairwoman Esther Nhlapo pleaded with the court not to grant Dube bail.ntwagaes@sowetan.co.za
