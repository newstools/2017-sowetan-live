South Africa will hear today who is to blame for the deaths of psychiatric patients when the health ombud s office presents its findings.Here are nine things you need to know:1) Mahlangu was warned of the danger a year in advanceIn June 2016 Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu relocated 1 900 patients from a government paid-for private care facility into 122 small non-governmental organisations in order to save more than R200 million a year.In June 2015 when the MEC made her plans to discharge the severely psychotic patients to NGOs the SA Society of Psychiatrists sent her a letter clearly stating that the country s NGOs did not have capacity to look after such sick people. 'They were greedy they forgot they were dealing with lives' - Families await health ombud report on pyschiatric patients' deaths 2) Families literally begged her to save their loved onesFamilies met with the MEC or her staff on Saturday mornings in November 2015 and told her their stories about their loved ones and how they were too sick to be discharged. Some patients were psychotic others dangerous and one even sets fire to property when alone.Some relatives like Reverend Joseph Maboe are 80 years old and unable to look after his son and he told the MEC s staff this. 'Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu must be fired' - Health Ombud 3) NGOs were forced to use the courts to save patients at ChristmasSection 27 and the SA Depression and Anxiety Group used the Johannesburg high court to stop patients being secretly discharged at Christmas time in 2015.In court the Gauteng department of health made promises that it would communicate with families about when loved ones were moved and also ensure patients were placed in appropriate accommodation.They never did this.4) Patients disappearedThe SA Depression and Anxiety Group got calls from relatives hunting high and low for relatives who had were discharged in June to unknown locations.5) Patients got typhoid meaning caregivers didn t wash their handsThe Takalani home for disabled children in Soweto was asked to take in psychiatric adults.At least two adults got typhoid at the NGO the health department confirmed last year. Typhoid is spread from poor hygiene after going to the toilet and poor hygiene practises when preparing food.6) Psychotic people were transported in taxisPatients in a home Braamfisherville were taken by taxi to fetch medication at the clinic even though they were psychotic and should have been kept at the home.7) Patients went to the barA family member discovered that her daughter left a NGO in Braamfisherville and went drinking at the local shebeen despite requiring supervision for severe bipolar disorder.8) Starving and thirsty to the point of deathReports from Precious Angels NGO where nine people died suggested that patients died of hunger and dehydration.One person who died at a home in Hammanskraal was thirsty when his father last saw him. Caregivers told the patient s dad they didn t want him to wet his bed so they didn t give him enough fluids.9) Even Ban-Ki-Moon got involvedThe United Nations called for a clear plan of action for looking after the remaining psychiatric patients after the first deaths were reported.
