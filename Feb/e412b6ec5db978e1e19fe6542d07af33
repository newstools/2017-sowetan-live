Notwithstanding apparent downward spiral, Baroka boss Khurishi Mphahlele believes that his struggling side will survive the relegation axe.Mphahlele's optimism seems to be misplaced, seeing that his team has no game plan following the chopping and changing of the technical staff last week.Tension is brewing in the technical team following the suspension without pay of head coach Jacob Sakala and technical director Mark Harrison, who have since sought legal advice to stop their suspension.Baroka are languishing at the bottom of the Absa Premiership standings after winning only two matches since they were promoted to the elite league. The 30 goals they have conceded so far points to a team with a porous defence.Within a week, Baroka conceded eight goals, humbled 5-0 by high-riding Bidvest Wits during a midweek fixture and 3-0 by second-placed Cape Town City on Sunday under the guidance of Kgoloko Thobejane.Against this backdrop, Mphahlele was still brimming with confidence yesterday, saying: "We can survive relegation easily if the right things are done properly on the field of play. We still have many matches to play. We will stage a comeback and I know for sure that this mission is possible. The people of Limpopo love this team and they will rally behind us."Asked about his influence on the team, Mphahlele was noncommittal, saying: "I've got no say regarding the game plan. I watch the game like any other person from the grandstand. If anyone wants to know what is happening in the team, that person should ask the coach and his players. I am clueless."Meanwhile, Mphahlele has denied receiving any correspondence from Sakala's lawyer, Arthur Dlamini."I have not received any letter from anyone. I cannot comment on this matter" he said.Sowetan understands that the suspended technical staff members are due to appear before the club's disciplinary hearing on March 6 and 13.Bakgaga, who have now lost 13 gamesthis season, face a tough Limpopo derby against Polokwane City this Sunday.
