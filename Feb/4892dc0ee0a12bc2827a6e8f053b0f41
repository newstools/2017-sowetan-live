These leaders are breaking other people's marriages and are also drunkards," he alleged.Chauke said: "We do spiritual rituals at our church.

That is witchcraft and not what our church stands for."The church's general secretary Jacob Mopelong said they took the five men to court because they did not want them to disrupt the church conference. He said the church would address the groups accusations after the conference. - tshehleb@sowetan.co.za
