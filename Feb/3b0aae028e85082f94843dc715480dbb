Contractor elated after public protector hands over cheque to bring 16-year payment battle with council to an end She remains convinced that the law is on her side regarding both the merits of the case and administrative justice implications of the Public Protector process. Madonsela said that she believed that she had not handled the situation in the best manner and apologised for the regrettable incident . Our moral compass is compromised when we forget that we are not echoes of those that are against us or appear to be so. Those of us who believe in a better world must be the first to do what we believe is right or needs to be done to achieve such a world she said.In an interview with the Citizen last week after Mkhwebane addressed journalists on her first 100 days in office Madonsela accused the new public protector of spreading fake news about her.Madonsela denied that she owed almost R500 000 for repairs to the damaged state-provided BMW and that she had used it for longer than allowed. I ve maintained silence because I believe that s a proper thing to do but it s not true that I still have to pay the money for the car or that I abused any car she told the newspaper.The foundation said Madonsela hoped to put the ordeal behind her and focus on her new projects.She is working on an autobiography.
