Six killer dogs were seized by the NSPCA on Thursday after they mauled a woman to death in the Fredville Inganga area west of Durban. Speaking from the scene NSPCA inspector Petros Simamane said: We got a call [in the morning] that dogs were attacking people. We managed to catch six dogs. There are four still running around. We are going to come back this afternoon to set a dog trap. The woman was reportedly walking to work when the dogs escaped through a hole in the fence of a homestead. The 59-year-old woman was attacked as she walked past. She died on the scene. The road she was using is one of the main routes used by children walking to school. - TMG Digital
