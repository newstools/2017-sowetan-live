Former Bafana Bafana captain Lucas "Rhoo" Radebe is unsure if there are enough local coaches to take over the vacant national team position."You look around and ask [yourself]: 'Do we have a local coach who can occupy that hot seat and be respected?' I don't know," Radebe told Sowetan, clearly suggesting that Safa was going to look beyond SA's borders to find their man.Radebe is on the selection committee that includes technical director Neil Tovey as Safa looks to head-hunt the new coach to take over from Shakes Mashaba by month end.Bafana are due to play international friendlies against Angola (away) and Guinea-Bissau (home) next month, before the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations and 2018 World Cup qualifiers."This gives us an opportunity to refresh and hopefully look for somebody who can take us further in the long term," said Radebe."We also need someone who is going into buy into the vision we have as an organisation. the aim is to sustain the success."Radebe, meanwhile, has been impressed with how the likes of Bidvest Wits, SuperSport United and Cape Town City are going toe-to-toe with the big three clubs in the Absa Premiership - Mamelodi Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates."Those teams are giving the big teams a hard time, which is great because it makes things interesting. It can only improve our football," he said.
