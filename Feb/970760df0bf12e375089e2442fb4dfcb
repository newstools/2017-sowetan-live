Highlands Park coach Gordon Igesund was livid at the manner in which match officials handled his team's Absa Premiership 1-1 draw fixture with Polokwane City on Sunday.The "Lions of the North" missed out on three points against "Rise and Shine" at Makhulong Stadium.Highlands led from the third minute throughPeter Shalulile but ended up sharing the spoils after substitute Sibusiso Jembula netted in the 94th minute."I am wondering if some of the decisions were actually genuine mistakes or the guys were overwhelmed by the magnitude of this game," said Igesund who was soaking wet with anger."I mean, there were moments where these guys made decisions that annoyed me so much that I freaked out. Look, you know me, I am not the one who criticises match officials," he said.Emotions ran high at the end of the game as Igesund and Highlands management remonstrated with match officials led by referee Shane Chuma. But order was restored before the situation got out of hand."We will be okay. That is all I can say for now. I am grossly disturbed," said Igesund who took over from Allan Freese last October.Club director Sinky Mnisi said: "I believe that we need to improve on our concentration. There is a tendency that we score first and concede late in our matches. Players must know that they must concentrate until the referee blows the final whistle."Meanwhile, Shalulile was playing his second match for Highlands after recovering from a long layoff due to injury.The Limpopo side replaced Walter Musona for Jembula, who re warded coach Luc Eymael with the all- important equaliser.
