The internal turmoil at Baroka FC took another twist when club chairman Khurishi Mphahlele strongly denied that he gave suspended coach Jacob Sakala an ultimatum to win four matches or face scrutiny from management.Mphahlele told Times Media Digital on Wednesday that it was Sakala who asked for four matches to turn things round at the basement club after the 2-1 defeat to Chippa United and the goalless draw with Platinum Stars.The four matches in question are tough encounters against BidVest Wits Polokwane City Cape Town City and Kaizer Chiefs. After our match against Platinum Stars we met to discuss what was holding us back and how we can solve the problems " Mphahlele said."My input to them was that when we played against Platinum Stars and Chippa United we played with the mentality of going for a draw."I asked them to do things differently in the next two matches against Bidvest Wits and Cape Town City and it was not a mandate to win all those two matches."But Sakala asked for four matches to turn things around and I still did not give them a mandate to win all those four matches."An attempt to get comment from Sakala and technical director Mark Harrison for their side of the story was unsuccessful as they did not answer their mobile phones.Mphahlele added that when Sakala Harrison and assistant coach Edward Williams asked for the four matches to move Baroka out of the relegation quagmire he then suggested that they put their agreement on paper.But they refused. When I asked them to sign it was my way of trying to see how serious they were about what they were requesting " he said."When they refused to sign the document I wondered if they meant what they were saying and that affected my trust."They have been suspended without pay and they will be appearing before a disciplinary committee next month."Kgoloko Thobejane will be in charge of the team for the time being."Mphahlele said the outcome of the DC will provide clarity on the way forward but he has no ill feeling towards the trio. We have had a disagreement and as adults we have to try and find each other for the benefit of the team."If we can t find each other then we will be left with no choice but to go our separate ways which will be the last resort for both of us."We reached out to them to beef up our technical team and so that they could help us to improve. At the moment I cannot say that we will not be able to work together going forward because of this misunderstanding."The outcome of the hearing will help us to find a way forward. Baroka take on Wits on Wednesday night at Bidvest Stadium in Johannesburg and Sakala Harrison and Williams will follow proceedings from a distance. - TMG Digital
