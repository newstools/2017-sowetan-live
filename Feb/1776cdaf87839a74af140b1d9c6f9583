It took the government and the Cullinan Centre caring for mentally ill patients five months to inform the family of Charity Ratsotso that she had died.These were one of the shocking revelations shared by Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba on Wednesday. A relative of Ratsotso had gone to visit her at the centre on 16 December 2016. Ratsotso was nowhere to be found. The centre sent him [the relative] home said Makgoba. Their explanation was that Ratsotso could have wandered off on the centre s grounds. On December 20 however the department paid the family a visit and informed them that Ratsotso had in fact died on July 11. Her body had been lying in the mortuary. Makgoba s statement was met with gasps of surprise from an audience which gathered in Pretoria where he released findings on the deaths of 94 mentally ill patients. The patients had been moved from the licensed Life Esidimeni in private homes to 27 unlicensed facilities.Makgoba said he experienced difficulty in finding out what had happened to Ratsotso as the department of health was reluctant to give him information. He said the 27 facilities had acted with negligence and recklessness. I don t believe everyone could have lived but I believe some of this could have been prevented Makgoba said. Several families were also present at the proceedings. One woman dressed in a red headscarf sat in the audience fanning herself with a notepad as she sobbed. Her eyes were puffy as she was comforted by those seated around her.
