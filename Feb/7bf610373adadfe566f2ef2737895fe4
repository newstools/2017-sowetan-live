University of Pretoria coach Shaun Bartlett believes that if they are to return to the Absa Premiership, AmaTuks must beat log leaders Thanda Royal Zulu in their NFD encounter at Tuks Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm)."If you want to be the best you have to beat the best, so we must win against Thanda. The game is not different from other games we have played but the boys are extra motivated because we are playing the team that is at the top of the table."Playing in the second tier league is not easy. I have told the lads to keep on pushing because we want to get out of here [in the NFD],'' Bartlett told Sowetan yesterday.He continued: "Our preparations were a bit disrupted by the rain but that was not a big deal. Going to this game, we have a full- strength squad. That will give us more options. Our previous win against Magesi last week was a morale boost. We want to continue with our winning momentum.''AmaTuks defeated the rookies from Limpopo 1-0 last Sunday.Nevertheless, the ex-Arrows coach acknowledges that it will not be a walk in the park to hand Amabhubesi their first defeat of the season."We know it will not be easy to end their [Thanda] unbeaten streak but we will give our best. We are not obsessed about them, but I have planned well for this fixture,'' the former Bafana Bafana striker stated.Bartlett's troops are seventh on the NFD standings with 26 points. After playing Thanda, the Pretoria-based outfit will visit struggling Real Kings at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on March 4.
