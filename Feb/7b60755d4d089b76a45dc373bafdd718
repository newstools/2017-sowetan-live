Growing up in one of the North West's rural villages, Olebogeng Mothibi never thought that he would one day make it as a successful businessman.Mothibi and his wife Kenalemang, both 36, own and manage their car wash and cleaning chemicals ventures.They said the entrepreneurial venture actually started off by a stroke of luck.The two recalled that while refilling their car with petrol one day at one of Kempton Park's garages, they saw a car wash that looked as if it was not well maintained."We approached the garage owner and asked about the car wash, [and] a week after our inquiry, he called us and asked us to take over immediately," the couple said.Running a car wash in a busy town was a bit scary at first for the two, but they said it was soon running like a well-oiled machine.With the profit that they made from the car wash, the Mothibis opened their second business, which is a shop selling cleaning chemicals and other accessories under the name Mothibi Industries.They said the idea came after most of their clients at the car wash asked if they sold the products they used to wash their cars."We then saw an opportunity right there and wondered why can't we start another business, which was selling the very same products that we were using," they said.The Mothibis opened the cleaning chemicals shop in Lichtenburg in November last year, about 40km from their birthplace of Bodibe village.The shop sells everything from cleaning detergents to refuse bins and floor mops.They buy the chemicals in bulk from a manufacturer and sell them to customers at a reasonable price.The two, who are also working in the OR Tambo International Airport precinct for two different companies, said they used the experience they got from their respective jobs to help them run their business.Kenalemang works as a customer service agent while Olebogeng works as a duty manager.They said their secret is to treat their customers with respect and deliver to their expectations.To give back to the community, they have already adopted a school in Kempton Park.The Mothibis said they hoped to one day focus solely on their businesses."We study world-known entrepreneurs and we learnt a lot from their experiences," said Olebogeng.Already there are guest houses and other institutions like the local municipality and local police station that are showing an interest in buying their products.The two previously used to sell almost anything on the street before opening the two businesses."We sold atchaar, bags, clothes and many other [products]," Kenalemng said.They said young people could play a role in business if they identify the right opportunities.They have already hired 10 people at the Kempton Park car wash and three people in Lichtenburg.tshehleb@sowetan.co.za
