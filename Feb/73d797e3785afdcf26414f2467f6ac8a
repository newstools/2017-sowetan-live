Outgoing Africa Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma believes there aren't enough female presidents in African countries.In a move that could be seen as her declaring her interest and availability to take over African National Congress (ANC) leadership when Jacob Zuma's term comes to an end in December, Dlamini-Zuma said that African countries should be encouraged to not overlook women when considering presidents.In a keynote address that focused on 'Women in Leadership' at church service in Khutsong, Dlamini-Zuma said that there is only one female president in Africa, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia whose term comes to an end in October.Her remarks come as the ANC presidential succession battle is heating up ahead of the party's elective conference in December.Dlamini-Zuma is the front-runner in the succession race along with deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and Baleka Mbete.The ANC Women's League has nominated Dlamini-Zuma as their preferred candidate to take over from Zuma in December, citing that it is high-time a woman leads the ruling party and the country."We want in Africa, that we should have women presidents. At the moment we have one from Liberia, her two-term ends in October this year which will mean we go back where only men are leading. We encourage African countries to also consider women to become presidents so that it's mixed," said Dlamini-Zuma.Although her remarks could be seen as declaring her availability to takeover leadership, Dlamini-Zuma is yet to make it official.President Jacob Zuma has also said that the ANC has been ready for a woman president. It is no longer a discussion in the ANC whether a woman can take a high leadership position or not. This discussion has been had before and the party agreed that anyone who is seen to have the qualities to lead the movement there won t be any problem for that person to do so Zuma said.
