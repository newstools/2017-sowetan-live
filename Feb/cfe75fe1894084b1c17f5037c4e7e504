Four days after their humiliating defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns, beleaguered Orlando Pirates could be in for another nightmare on the pitch when they face one of the deadliest attacks at Orlando Stadium today (7.30pm).The wounded Buccaneers, who were made to look like amateurs in their 6-0 defeat to the defending league champions on Saturday, now have to tame a Bidvest Wits attack many coaches can only dream of having.With Phakamani Mahlambi, James Keene, Gabadinho Mhango Elias Pelembe, Daine Klate, Mogakolodi Ngele, Eleazar Rodgers, Sifiso Myeni and Cuthbert Malajila, Wits are capable of repeating what SuperSport United and Sundowns have done by putting six goals past the Buccaneers.But that's not all. Wits' central defenders Thulani Hlatshwayo and Buhle Mkhwanazi pose a big threat with their height whenever set piece opportunities are presented in the opposition half.Aware of what they are going to come up against tonight, Pirates are likely to make changes to a defence that has conceded 23 goals in 15 matches.New signings James Okwuosa and Marc van Heerden had debuts to forget against Sundowns and they may not have done enough to keep their places in the starting line-up. It would come as no surprise if Happy Jele returns after sitting on the bench at Loftus. We could also see the return of Edwin Gyimah, who was at the Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon.In attack, 10th placed Pirates need to do more to give top scorer Tendai Ndoro the supply he needs. In the club's last two matches, the Zimbabwean marksman has been chasing shadows, drifting down the midfield to search for the ball, yet he should be in the box where he is most dangerous.A stern talk with chairman Irvin Khoza, and the news that a new coach will be announced on Monday, could just do the trick to get the best out of the Pirates players today.Khoza was due to have a meeting with the players yesterday to get to the root of the problems in the squad.
