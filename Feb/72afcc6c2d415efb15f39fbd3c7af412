The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have a long way to go before they can emulate the EFC the mixed martial arts brand.The honourable member who threw the first punch while being pushed by the White Shirt brigade had his fist wrapped around a plastic water bottle.Many street-fighters use knuckledusters or broken glass bottles but a plastic water bottle must be a first.Was he planning on drowning his opponent or actually trying to help resuscitate him mid-fight like a trainer does to a boxer at the end of each round?WATCH: Sign language translator interprets 'f*** you' in Parliament The hard hats used by some of his teammates seemed a little bit more effective but their throw-and-run tactic wasn t sustainable.Remember the one settler one bullet cry of the PAC? Well one White Shirt one hat doesn t quite have the same ring and we could see why. Generally soldiers carry more bullets than hats.And spare a thought for EFF commander-in-chief Julius Malema. He stood like a true pacifist holding his bottle of water with peaceful intent as he watched the White Shirts storm into his comrades.EFF s warning to Parliament s bouncers: We are going to beat the bastards You can kill me. It s fine kill me. Just kill me there s no problem kill me he told the speaker before being driven several metres up-house by a sneaky White Shirt attack from the rear.Given what spectators pay in tax this rumble was sub-standard all they got was a whole lot of wrestling hat-throwing and one inEFFective punch.Maybe next time someone should try a roundHOUSE punch or kick seeing this is Parliament?
