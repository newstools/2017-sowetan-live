SAFA is moving closer to appointing a new Bafana Bafana coach, but it won't meet today's deadline it had set out of naming their man.A meeting chaired by Safa president Danny Jordaan was held at Safa House yesterday to start finalising the process to get someone to take up the job left vacant after Shakes Mashaba was fired in December.The technical committee, which includes former national team heroes Benni McCarthy, Lucas Radebe and Neil Tovey as well as development coach Farouk Khan, will submit the name of the coach they think is best suited to take up the job.But it's the Safa national executive committee (NEC) that has the final say on who is appointed.Carlos Queiroz remains a favourite of Jordaan and he could convince the NEC that the former Real Madrid manager should have a second spell at the helm of Bafana.Queiroz, however, neither have the experience nor the success on the African continent set out by Safa in their selection criteria. He helped Iran qualify for the 2014 World Cup and this could work in his favour, as Safa wants someone to inspire Bafana to 2018 World Cup qualification.Hugo Broos can also not be ruled out after performing miracles with a young Cameroon side at the Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon.Herve Renard, another man on the shortlist, is likely to be attracted by the Ghana job. Reports in Ghana suggest he has put in his CV for a job left vacant following the departure of Avram Grant after the Afcon finals.
