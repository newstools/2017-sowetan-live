The Democratic Alliance says it will request that the Auditor-General (AG) Thembekile Makwetu launch an independent investigation into the gross mismanagement of funds by Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane.This follows reports on Sunday that her department is effectively bankrupt. The DA has also written to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Water and Sanitation Mr Mlungisi Johnson to request that he urgently summon Minister Nomvula Mokonyane to appear before the Committee and provide a full testimony on the allegations said DA spokesman on water and sanitation Heinrich Volmink.He added that senior officials from the Treasury and the Auditor-General should be called upon to appear before the committee during the same briefing to provide further testimony. If the Minister either fails to appear before the Committee and/or the Committee is not convinced that the testimony provided can give a full assurance to the South African public that the Water and Sanitation Department is not in crisis a strong recommendation should be made for the Minister s immediate dismissal.
