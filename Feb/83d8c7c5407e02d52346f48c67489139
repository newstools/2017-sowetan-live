A Limpopo teacher could lose her job after she allegedly locked a young pupil inside a classroom and left him there after school.The alleged incident happened a week ago at the Mamotshana Primary School in Sekonye village, Botlokwa, 70km north of Polokwane.The teacher allegedly punished the pupil (name withheld) for not completing written class work.The pupil was lucky not to have spent the night in the classroom after his mother questioned his schoolmates when they returned home without her seven-year-old son.The 26-year-old mother said she went to the school, found her son locked in the classroom and in a state of shock. She called the principal and members of the school governing body, who came to witness her son locked inside."I'm still surprised at the conduct of the teacher who locked my son inside the classroom for the night. She went home to sleep with her children, while mine was left to sleep alone with no blankets, let alone a toilet to relieve himself," she said.She said the teacher had left her son inside the classroom when she left for home at about 1pm and told him he would only be freed the following day.Chairman of the school governing body Willie Manaka said: "The punishment meted out to the young pupil is worrisome and after a meeting of parents we have arrived at a decision that the teacher must go."We no longer want her back at the school," he said yesterday.He said they had written to the circuit office to inform the provincial education department of their decision, which they wanted implemented "immediately".The mother said the teacher had called to apologise. "The teacher is heartless. What if I had not been home and something bad had happened to my son and he ended up spending the night inside the classroom?" she asked.Manaka said counselling had been arranged for the pupil.Efforts to contact the teacher were fruitless, while the principal referred queries to the department.Department spokesman Naledzani Rasila said yesterday it was "unacceptable" for a teacher to give such a punishment. "If that matter gets formally reported to us we will conduct an investigation and deal harshly with the teacher in question," Rasila said.He urged the school's management to speed up the process of escalating the matter to them so that they could deal with the facts.frankm@sowetan.co.za
