The independent Police Investigative Directorate will oppose the court challenge by acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane to ensure the legality of their corruption investigation into him.Earlier on Monday Phahlane s legal team filed an application in the Pretoria High Court to stop an investigation by the Directorate into him.Part of the application is to get an interdict to stop the Directorate from using private forensic investigator Paul O Sullivan to assist them in their investigation into Phahlane.Phahlane is under investigation for alleged corrupt activities which include that he received kickbacks from contract providers who were awarded tenders to supply chemicals to the police forensic science laboratory which the commissioner used to head.Directorate spokesman Moses Dlamini said while they had yet to receive the papers they would oppose them. We will definitely defend against this legal application he said.
