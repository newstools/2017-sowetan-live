Bafana Bafana could have two coaches come next month.That is, if axed Shakes Mashaba fails to stop the SA Football Association (Safa) from filling the vacant post and the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) reinstates him. The CCMA hearing is set for March 7, 8, and 9.Yesterday, Mashaba approached the Labour Court to interdict his former employers from filling the post until the CCMA has finalised his dismissal challenge matter.But Safa has indicated that it is not necessary for Mashaba to interdict them from replacing him. The association said it would welcome him back should the CCMA rule that he was unfairly fired from his job in December - even if they have already replaced him.Safa's advocate Anton Myburgh SC said upon his reinstatement, Mashaba would be dealt with operationally in terms of applicable labour law. He will know whether the interdict succeeds on Tuesday next week after Labour Court Judge Robert Lagrange reserved judgment in the matter yesterday.But Myburgh said Safa wanted Mashaba's replacement in place for Bafana's friendlies on the week of March 20-28.Mashaba wants to be in charge when the national team takes on Nigeria in the opening game of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers and has proposed that his assistants, Owen da Gama and Thabo Senong, guide Bafana in the March friendlies. Mashaba's lawyer Claudio Bollo said his client would accept the appointment of his replacement if the new coach would also be dealt with operationally should he be reinstated.Bollo dismissed the claim that Mashaba's relationship with his bosses had broken down. He said Safa chief executive Dennis Mumble admitted that he liked the former Bafana mentor and would move with him to another organisation.This is despite Mumble saying at Mashaba's disciplinary hearing that the relationship between the duo had broken down. Bollo said Safa's claim that Mashaba's relationship with its president Danny Jordaan had also broken down was contrary to the two being friendly and shaking hands after the match against Senegal, which Bafana won 2-1.Mashaba reportedly wagged a finger and angrily remonstrated at Safa officials - including Jordaan - ahead of his post-match interview.Bollo said the 66-year-old wants to fulfil his dream of leading his country to the 2018 World Cup in Russia after Safa waived its retirement policy to hire him in July 2014.
