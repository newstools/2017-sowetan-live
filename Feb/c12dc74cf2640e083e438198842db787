SUPERSPORT United defender Morgan Gould believes the current Absa Premiership campaign will go down to the wire.Gould is well-placed to comment, having been a part of a PSL championship winning side on four occasions and knowing what it takes to be at the top.The no-nonsense defender is adamant that the current crop of SuperSport players are capable of finishing ahead of title chasers like Kaizer Chiefs, Cape Town City, Bidvest Wits and defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns . Gould, who is in his 15th PSL season, told Sowetan that SuperSport have the quality and experience to fight to the end."We want it to go to the wire. It's been exciting times in South Africa . You can say what you want, that the level has dropped, but I don't think so. The level has lifted and, look at Sundowns, they went on to win the CAF Champions League," said Gould."I think we have the players capable of working for one another. At SuperSport our motto is that we all stand together as a team and just push each other."SuperSport, who play Free State Stars tonight (7.30pm) at James Motlatsi Stadium in Orkney, North West, also have to contend with the CAF Confederation Cup programme.They drew 0-0 with Madagascar's Elgeco Plus at the weekend in the preliminary stage of the competition and will look to finish the job at home next weekend.And with the games coming thick and fast, the 33-year-old Gould has backed SuperSport to do well on the domestic and continental fronts."We will need to work as a team and work smart to win the league." If you look at the current champions [Sundowns], they are picking up points and are getting back to the swing of things."So we've got a hard road ahead of us," he said.
