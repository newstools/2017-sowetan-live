We know that we are representing a big brand and that comes with a lot of challenges. We are a team that really wants to win at all times. We need to be on top of our game every time we take to the pitch," he said."I'm glad that I'm leading a bunch of professionals and they know their responsibilities in terms of what we are expecting from them. We can't drop the ball now as we are the African champions. We have to put the trophy [the Super Cup] in the cabinet and start grinding again."The 31-year-old also acknowledged the increasing number of supporters at their games. Kekana was pleased with the turnout at Loftus Stadium where there were an estimated 32 000 fans, including those of Mazembe.
