Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has backed the team's strikers to come good in the second half of the season.Amakhosi are heading into the second round of the Absa Premiership with defender Lorenzo Gordinho the team's leading scorer with three goals, a tally he shares with winger George Lebese.Khune, however, has thrown his weight behind the misfiring front-men as Chiefs build up to their league clash against Free State Stars at FNB Stadium on Tuesday.Kick-off is 7.30pm."The six-week break gave us an opportunity to work on a lot of things including finishing. I was looking at the goal-scoring charts and a team like Chiefs should be the one dominating [but] none of our guys are there [on the PSL top scorers charts]," said Khune after his team's work-out at the club's base in Naturena yesterday.Chiefs have scored 18 goals in 15 league games and are currently fourth in the standings.Asked if new striker Gustavo Paez is the real deal, Khune has nothing but praise for the Venezuelan striker who was born to Italian parents."I'm very impressed and everyone is impressed with him. He's very mobile and very hungry in front of goal."He's been scoring lots of goals for us in friendly matches, hence the club rewarded him with a contract," said the Bafana Bafana keeper.From a defensive perspective, Chiefs appear solid with just 12 goals conceded.Now Khune is hoping that his side will continue with their positive run towards the end of last year when Amakhosi raked up maximum points from two straight matches. "We want to start the year the way we ended 2016."Meanwhile, striker Camaldine Abraw has been re-registered after recovering from a knee injury.
