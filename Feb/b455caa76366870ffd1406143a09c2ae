A man of the cloth whose church yesterday partnered with a bank that gave President Jacob Zuma a R7.8-million loan to repay the Nkandla debt said he had no close ties to Zuma.The church leader, Caesar Nongqunga, was speaking to Sowetan on the sidelines of a press briefing yesterday in Sunninghill, Johannesburg, where both institutions were announcing a partnership.This is despite reports that Zuma attended his church's services in the past."I do not know why people think I have this close relationship with the president. I am not a member of the ANC. I am not a member of any hierarchy of government," said Nongqunga.He said because he was not judgemental towards Zuma people thought they were friends."He goes to each and every church but all those people who are inviting him are not called his friends. I am the only person who is called his friend. Why?Church stole my son's college funds - mom "He does not even come to my house so that we can have tea together."The partnership between Twelve Apostles Church in Christ and the bank means that members can make financial contributions like offerings through the bank.Church members will be allocated VBS bank cards to use when they pay tithes or make offerings.The bank came under the spotlight in September when it offered Zuma a home loan of R7.8-million to pay back some of the improvements at his home in Nkandla, as directed by the Constitutional Court.The church claims a membership of 6.8 million in 28 countries in Africa and overseas, which means VBS now potentially has close to 7-million new clients.Zuma's son launches scathing attack on Gordhan Jonas and De Klerk Nongqunga said the VBS deal was not political.VBS chief executive Andile Ramavhunga said the partnership meant they were given the sole mandate to provide the church with all its financial services solutions."We recognise that the needs of customers are unique and specific. Therefore, the solutions we deliver are tailor-made and innovative. This was the basis of the partnership."We share a common purpose with the church, which is to improve the lives of our communities and bringing about transformation," he said.Ramavhunga said part of the services to be rendered by the bank to the church will include the implementation of a membership banking card solutions to the church members."This will help the church ease the management of the membership records by enabling a centralised banking and investment."Nongqunga said one of the reasons for the partnership was to solve the difficulty churches faced in getting funding from banks."Without funds no one can lead a church," he said.
