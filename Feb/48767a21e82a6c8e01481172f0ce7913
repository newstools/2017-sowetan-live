Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has weighed in over the pitch invasion by Orlando Pirates supporters during the Bucs disastrous 6-0 thrashing at the hands of Mamelodi Sundowns at the weekend.The EFF commander in chief deviated from his anti-government rhetoric during a press conference on Tuesday to lobby a grenade at the supposed fans of the game. We don t agree with violence. Even this thing of Pirates was not correct. Pirates is a big club and must be respected he said.The PSL match was delayed for an hour in Pretoria on Saturday after Percy Tau s 82nd-minute sixth goal sparked a pitch invasion first by Pirates fans then those of Sundowns in response resulting in fist-fights violence and injuries.The players coaching staff and benches of both sides sprinted for the safety of the change-rooms.After the PSL s security officials were overwhelmed an SA Police Services armoured vehicle entered the pitch and teargas and stun grenades were fired.The match resumed after the delay and was completed but only after fans were treated for injuries by paramedics on the field.The Premier Soccer League has also strongly condemned ... the acts of hooliganism by some of the fans and apologised to all the supporters and stakeholders those who were at the stadium and also those watching on television. Such behaviour at our stadiums is a bad advert for our football.
