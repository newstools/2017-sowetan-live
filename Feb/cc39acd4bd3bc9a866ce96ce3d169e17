The Democratic Alliance is so intent on winning the 2019 election that party leader Mmusi Maimane has already sketched a plan to rescue South Africa and particularly the youth.Giving what appeared to be his own state of the nation address in Cape Town on Wednesday Maimane said more focus needed to be placed on educating young South Africans equipping them with skills and getting them into the workplace. His speech outlined a rescue mission for a lost generation by the party.He said the country spent R280 billion each year on education but the results achieved did not match the expenditure.The DA s plan should they come to power in 2019 which he outlined in a 45 minute speech to mostly party members and members of the diplomatic corps involved nurturing children from a young age by developing effective feeding schemes and ensuring a focus on reading writing and calculation skills in the foundation phases. The DA is contesting these elections with the aim of winning he said.Maimane also advocated the re-opening of teacher training colleges a free year of vocational training for pupils who did not qualify for access to university and a private sector apprenticeship and a government sector internship programme.But he said this would mean nothing if there was no job market to absorb young people and outlined plans to invest in innovation scrap the nuclear build programme in favour of independent power producers and privatising state owned entities by selling shares to workers and excluded groups.He also said the party would train 50 000 more police officers and give farmers incentives to give workers shares in their farms.
