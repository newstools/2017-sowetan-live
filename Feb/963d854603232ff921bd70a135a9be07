Due to rehabilitation work on the Double Decker Bridge on the M1 freeway the Johannesburg Roads Agency has issued an advisory to motorists to be aware of increased lane restrictions over the next two weeks.The affected section will be on the bridge between Carr and Anderson streets.Between Saturday 4 February and Saturday 18 February two lanes out of the four lanes northbound within the Double Decker section will be closed.During peak hours this restriction will be reduced to the closure of only one lane the JRA said in a statement on Friday. Motorists are urged to familiarise themselves with the lane reductions during off-peak and peak times plan their routes in advance to avoid delays and to consider alternative routes the agency said. Motorists can check the JRA website for more information at: www.jra.org.zaThe M1 is a key arterial route and carries more than 80 000 private cars daily along with commercial traffic and public transport vehicles such as minibus taxis and buses.The city began a R200 million programme to rehabilitate three bridges on the M1 among other work in April last year. The project is part of a R110 billion plan announced in 2013 to upgrade road infrastructure in the city over 10 years.
