SuperSport United defender Morgan Gould believes the current Absa Premiership campaign will go down to the wire.Gould, 33, is well-placed to comment, having been a part of a PSL championship winning side on four occasions and knowing what it takes to be at the top.The no-nonsense defender is adamant that the current crop of SuperSport players are capable of finishing ahead of title chasers like Kaizer Chiefs, Cape Town City, Bidvest Wits and defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns .Gould, who is in his 15th PSL season, told Sowetan that SuperSport have the quality and experience to fight to the end.SuperSport, who play Free State Stars tonight (7.30pm) at James Motlatsi Stadium in Orkney, North West, have to contend with the CAF Confederation Cup programme.They drew 0-0 with Madagascar's Elgeco Plus at the weekend in the preliminary stage of the competition and will look to finish the job at home next weekend.And with the games coming thick and fast, Gould has backed SuperSport to do well on the domestic and continental fronts.
