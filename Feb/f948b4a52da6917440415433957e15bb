Despite mounting calls for the voting system around the 16th annual Metro FM Awards to be relooked the public broadcaster has said that no decision has been made as yet.Artists including Kwesta Riky Rick Babes Wodumo and Khuli Chana have publicly expressed their disdain at the results hinting that the votes just don t add up.The SABC told TshisaLIVE that artists were aware of the voting system at the time of the launch and made it clear that there were only 500 SMS s allowed per number for votes. Previous competitions allowed for an unlimited amount of votes per number. We have not reached a decision on anything yet. Each system has its cons. I said at the launch that these were the rules and you can t change the rules at the end of the game said the SABC s Kaizer Kganyago.Kganyago wouldn t say whether the results would be released to the public but did admit that it was an option.The SABC released results of the SABC Song of the Year competition after there were calls for the votes to be recounted. Mroza s Van Damme won Song of the Year to the surprise of many.
