Dwaine Pretorius gutsy half-century wasn t enough to get South Africa over the line in the second one-day international against New Zealand in Christchurch on Wednesday.No. 7 batsman Pretorius who was also his team s best bowler with figures of 2/40 hammered 50 off 27 balls to keep South Africa in contention.But the home side fought back to win by six runs and deny the visitors what would have been a record 13th consecutive success in ODIs.New Zealand powered by Ross Taylor s unbeaten 102 and half-centuries by Kane Williamson and Jimmy Neesham totalled 289/4.South Africa who needed 15 to win when Pretorius was dismissed with the last ball of the penultimate over were held to 283/9. Winning s nice - it s better than the other thing Williamson said after his team had levelled a series that will resume in Wellington on Saturday.Taylor s ton was his 17th ODI hundred and made him New Zealand s leading century-maker in the format. But he might have scored it in a losing cause were it not for the stands of 104 and an unbroken 123 he shared with Williamson and Neesham.Williamson joined Taylor after New Zealand had stumbled to 53/2 in the 13th over and scored 69. Neesham hammered his 71 not out off 57 balls.Among South Africa s bowlers only Chris Morris and Pretorius got away with conceding fewer than a run-a-ball but the villains of the piece for the visitors were their batsmen.Quinton de Kock who made 57 was their only other player to score a half-century despite four others facing more than 30 balls and forging solid starts to their innings.Too many South Africans fell to soft dismissals including AB de Villiers - who bottom-edged a slower bouncer from Trent Boult and was caught behind for 45.Pretorius lashed four fours and two sixes in his aggressive innings but South Africa s challenge ended when he he was bowled by a full toss from Boult to end a ninth-wicket stand of 61 he shared with Andile Phehlukwayo. Boult took 3/63. - TMG Digital.
