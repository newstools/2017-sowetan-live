The SA Football Association (Safa) and sacked Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba will meet at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) offices next week.Sowetan can confirm that the two parties will meet on February 7 in Johannesburg and Mashaba's first priority will be to seek reinstatement.Mashaba was sacked after a disciplinary committee found him guilty of gross misconduct, insubordination and violating the communications policy of Safa.This happened after the coach's public outburst in Polokwane in November where Mashaba had a go at Safa bosses and the media following his side's 2-1 victory over Senegal in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.The 66-year-old's contract was due to expire after the World Cup in Russia. It is believed that he was taking home R500000 a month.If Mashaba's bid for reinstatement fails, his legal representative, Claudio Bollo, is on record as saying that he will be looking for compensation. Bollo couldn't be reached for comment yesterday and Safa spokesman Dominic Chimhavi was out of the office.Mashaba was in charge of Bafana for 841 days.
