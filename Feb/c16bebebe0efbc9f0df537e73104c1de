Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba announced on Tuesday that long serving MMC for Environment and infrastructure Anthony Still had stepped down due to differing views on the investigation into City Power tenders.The local ANC however said Still did not walk out but was fired by the DA mayor.In a statement Mashaba said I have sat down with MMC Still and discussed the matter extensively. Unfortunately we held a difference of opinion on the approach to tackling matters of investigations into alleged fraud and corruption within City Power .Speaking to TMG Digital the spokesperson for the ANC in Johannesburg Jolidiee Mathongo said Still had disagreed with Mashaba over the investigation into City Power tenders saying it was a waste of taxpayers money as previous investigations had already looked into the matter. The issue with Still is that he was against yet another investigation into City Power tenders when reliable audits had been done by audit firms such as EMS KPMG as well as the Public Protector said Mathongo.Since he became mayor Mashaba has commissioned investigations into any allegations of corruption in the city.He hired former Gauteng Hawks boss Shadrack Sibiya to lead the probes.He has also proposed to council for Pikitup Joburg Water and City Power to be reintegrated into the control of council.Currently these entities are governed by the Companies Act and have a board of directors overseeing their functioning. The move has been welcomed by the SA Municipal Workers Union. TMG Digital/The Times
