Five successive semifinal appearances all failed to hand Ghana the African Nations Cup title but they play a sixth in a row with the status of favourites when they meet Cameroon in Franceville on Thursday.The match will decide who plays Egypt in Sunday s final after the first semifinal on Wednesday delivered a heartbreaking post-match penalty shootout reversal for Burkina Faso in Libreville.Ghana s Black Stars have been nothing if not consistent since 2008 when they hosted the tournament but their own party was spoilt by Cameroon in the semifinal.Two subsequent finals and two fourth-place finishes attest to their capabilities but the cutting edge has been lacking and so they have remained without a trophy since their last in 1982.Cameroon have not had any success since they won in 2002 and their progress to the last four has been something of a surprise given the defections from their squad before the tournament kicked off and the youthful and inexperienced nature of their lineup.A determined side have proven the depth in the country but it could be that having got this far Cameroon veer off course because of the issue of money.Although they agreed with their sports ministry and football federation about the amount of the bonuses before the kick-off of the competition the Indomitable Lions now want an increase because of their unexpected advance to the semifinal. It s true that we not just the players but the whole group are not happy about the bonuses coach Hugo Broos said on Wednesday. No one saw us getting to this stage of the competition but given our performance I think it s normal for the players and the whole group to want something more. It s not because we are not very happy with the bonuses that we are going to stop preparing for the semifinal but it is important to emphasise this. The players did not come to this Nations Cup just for the money he added in an attempt to assure fans his team s focus was still fixed on the final.Ghana had a different problem on the eve of the game as they were still battling over the fitness of star striker Asamoah Gyan.A groin injury ruled their captain out of the quarterfinal win over the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday. Our doctors have worked hard with him and he is recovering little by little said assistant coach Maxwell Konadu at the pre-game press conference in Franceville. We cannot confirm for now whether he will be ready to play or not but he was able to trot and do some exercises with the ball [on Tuesday]. We ll just have to wait and see what's going to happen. It will be unlikely that Avram Grant risks him so Jordan Ayew will again lead the attack which he did with unusual aplomb in the last game.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
