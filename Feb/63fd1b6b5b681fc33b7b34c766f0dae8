Cinematographer and director Samuel Leburu says the South African education system should start teaching young people how to become entrepreneurs who build their own companies.Leburu says such an approach to education will help reduce the high unemployment rate among the youth.Hailing from Kagiso, west of Johannesburg, the businessman told Sowetan his career began when he landed an internship at a production house called Tri-cam.During this time, he got to work at TV sports channel, SuperSport as a camera operator for seven months.The Wits University graduate said upon completion of the internship, he worked for the SABC news department as a camera operator and then got promoted to work on long format and current affairs news, such as Special Assignment, Cutting Edge and Leihlo la Sechaba.Leburu was chosen by Fifa TV, where he was trained as a cinematographer from 2009 to 2010, in preparation for the World Cup held in SA in 2010.This paved the way for him as a freelance cinematographer. He then worked for Red Pepper Pictures on shows like Shiz Niz, Club 808 and Rolling with Zola.To date, Leburu has established his own production company called LeburuGraphy Pictures and says this was one of the biggest highlights of his career.He is also a mentor, who loves teaching young people the craft."I think I have influence among the youth because I have mentored a lot of young photographers, directors, and camera operators. I still receive a lot of requests from other people to mentor them and help them grow their craft."Leburu says he gets gratification from helping people who are less fortunate than himself, especially aspiring filmmakers who needed mentoring and financial assistance.He says he has faced challenges in the film and television industry as a cinematographer trying to get his business off the ground, adding that he has found his strength in God."I believe that God is forever leading me and everything I achieve is all through him".
