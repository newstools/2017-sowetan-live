Former Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim Shakes Mashaba has approached the Labour Court to stop the appointment of a new head coach until the finalisation of his dismissal challenge at the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) on Tuesday.Mashaba was fired as national team coach in December after a disciplinary committee found him guilty of gross misconduct insubordination and violating the communications policy of the South African Football Association (Safa). This followed the then coach s public outburst in November in Polokwane where he had a go at Safa bosses and the media following his side s 2-1 victory over Senegal.His lawyer Advocate Claudio Bollo argued that appointing a new head coach while Mashaba is still challenging his dismissal at the CCMA will cause irreparable harm to him. If a reinstatement order is granted we will have two head coaches. Don t allow them [Safa] at the CCMA to say we ve already employed someone argued Bollo.He said Safa has indicated that a head coach will be identified by the end of February a month before the CCMA matter. If they should appoint a coach while the CCMA matter is unfolding this will cause Mr Mashaba irreparable harm Bollo said.He said Mashaba stands a good chance of being reinstated as head coach. We ve made out a case that has not been challenged here. Reinstatement [of Mashaba] is a possibility. - TMG Digital
