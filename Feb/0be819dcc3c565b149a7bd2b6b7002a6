Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane holds Chippa United in high regard for a couple of reasons.Chippa coach Dan Malesela plays enterprising football and they often give Sundowns a tough game. They've played each other three times this season, twice in the MTN8 and once in the league, and Sundowns have managed to get just one victory over this Chippa side.Two weeks after playing to a 1-1 draw at Siza Dukashe Stadium, Sundowns face a Chippa side that knows only one way of playing football - on the ground.When they met in East London a fortnight ago, the poor state of the pitch did not allow for the teams to play enterprising football and they could face the same problem at Loftus today (7.30pm).Sundowns will move to the top of the standings on goal difference if they win tonight, with games still in hand."I hope the pitch will be right because Chippa likes to play football. Dance [Malesela] is always a difficult opponent, I think you know that," said Mosimane."You could see that Arrows played a different game against Chippa [on Friday]. Arrows play a pass and dribbling game, but now it's second round, you must get the points or you are out."I hope we play football, but the right people that we need, like Anthony [Laffor] and Khama [Billiat], are injured."Sundowns will also be without Tiyani Mabunda, who is serving a suspension, but Lucky Mohomi should prove a capable replacement in the centre of the park.Without Laffor and Billiat in attack, Mosimane can always rely on Sibusiso Vilakazi to make a difference.Against Wits on Saturday, Vilakazi returned to the starting line-up for the first time since the 1-0 victory over Bloemfontein Celtic early this month and scored."Vila is a big player for big games. Against Chiefs he scored. Against Wits he scores again. And you can see the finishing is of a big player. I bought the right player," said Mosimane."I played him on the side and he can do it. So he can play anywhere."
