Violent student protests have forced the Durban University of Technology to shut down two of its Pietermaritzburg campuses until Monday.Angry students threw stones and burnt tyres on Wednesday morning in protest against high food prices and not being granted funding for food by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. They have also demanded that some B-Tech students who have outstanding fees be unblocked for registration.Alan Khan DUT spokesman said staff and non-protesting students were unable to access the campus. In order to ensure the safety of our staff and students until the matter has been resolved university management has taken the decision to suspend the academic programme at the Indumiso and Riverside campuses for the rest of the week. Khan said students have been instructed to vacate residences within 24 hours effective from Wednesday afternoon. Only registered students will be allowed back into residence on Sunday from 2pm. He said lectures would resume on Monday. The university acknowledges that this interruption is not ideal and it compromises the thousands of students in Pietermaritzburg who want to be in class. However with the violence on display . and following consultation with the police a decision was taken in the best interest of safety and security for all DUT staff and students in the midlands said Khan.
