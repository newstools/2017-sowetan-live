One of the four men accused of kidnapping and killing two people before abandoning their bodies at a cemetery received three life sentences plus 41 years for the crimes.Thabiso Dube 22 was convicted on eight charges that he pleaded guilty to in the North West High Court sitting in the Moretele Magistrate s Court.He was charged with two counts each of murder kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances and one charge of rape and possession of an unlicensed firearm. The three life sentences will run concurrently with the 41 years and Dube will serve an effective life imprisonment. Dube was arrested together with Tankiso Metsing 28 Johannes Ndala 30 and Sinky Makhomisani 24 who pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial was separated from that of his co-accused. He admitted that he killed Sifiso Donald Vilakazi and Khomotso Mmabana Pila in the early hours of December 6 2015. He had also robbed the two and brutally raped Pila. Pila and Vilakazi were kidnapped in Tembisa on the East Rand and their bodies were discovered at Mokoni cemetery near Stinkwater in Hammanskraal north of Pretoria about 80km away. When the bodies were discovered a screwdriver was found stuck in Pila s pubic area. Dube said he regretted his actions. He said he killed the victims because he knew that they would identify him and his co-accused and they did not want to be arrested. He said he stabbed the victims with a broken bottle. Dube also admitted that he raped Pila and stabbed her with a screwdriver in her private parts. Judge Tebogo Djaje said she could not find a reason that could persuade her to divert from the minimum prescribed sentence of life imprisonment on the charges of rape and murder. Dube had initially asked the court to sentence him to 30 years imprisonment. He said he needed time to think about what he did and learn from it.
