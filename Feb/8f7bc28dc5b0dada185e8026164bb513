Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt has spiced things up ahead of his side's crunch Absa Premiership match against Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus tomorrow by saying the title is Sundowns' to lose.Sundowns are five points behind league leaders Wits with three matches in hand, but anyone would tell you that games in hand do not guarantee points. Hunt, however, feels Sundowns are in the best position compared to other title chasers."To be fair, if you look at points and games that they've got, it's theirs to lose. And to be fair, what they've done there is unbelievable. We've got great respect for them and we have great humility going there."They've won trophies outside the country and they won the league [last season] by a country mile. We know what we are up against," said Hunt, who's happy to be at the summit but admits it means nothing at this stage."You always want to be in front [but] we've only played 16 games, so it's a long way to go."The 5-0 victory Wits secured against Baroka at home on Wednesday improved their goal difference to +13. Having won the 2008/2009 league title with SuperSport on goal difference, Hunt knows the importance of scoring and keeping clean sheets. "We had to close the goal difference gap. I've won the league on goal difference, so I know what it's about."There are four or five teams that can win this league, so it's going to be close until the end."
