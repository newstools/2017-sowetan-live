With their back-to-back victories before the long mid-season break, Kaizer Chiefs raised expectations that they will be a force reckon with when the second half of the season gets under way tomorrow.By winning those matches - against Polokwane City and Golden Arrows - Amakhosi put themselves in a good position to challenge for the league title, but they need the type of character that was shown by some of the previous generations to lift their fifth title.The late Ted Dumitru's Amakhosi outfit came back from 10 points to beat rivals Orlando Pirates to the title in 2004/2005 while Stuart Baxter's side recovered from surrendering the title in 2013/2014 to clinch it the following campaign with a record points tally.Currently a point behind leaders SuperSport United, Steve Komphela's boys need to be consistent and make the FNB Stadium a fortress, starting with their match against Free State Stars tomorrow (7.30pm). The fourth-placed side has dropped eight points in home matches at this venue so far.Ea Lla Koto, with new coach Serame Letsoaka, will give Amakhosi a challenge, considering they are fighting relegation. They desperately need points to move away from 14th place."It's always tough playing against Free State Stars," Chiefs' Siphiwe Tshabalala said on the sidelines of the Nedbank Cup launch last week.One of Chiefs' major concerns in the first round was their lack of fire power upfront.However, Bernard Parker found some form late last year and they need him, along with new striker Gustavo Paez, to find the back of the net regularly to turn what has been a bumpy campaign into a smoother one.FIXTURES(all 7.30pm)TomorrowChiefs v FS Stars, FNB StadiumWits v Ajax, Bidvest StadiumCPT City v Highlands, Cape Town StadiumChippa v Baroka, Nelson Mandela BayWednesdaySuperSport v Arrows, Lucas Moripe StadiumPlat Stars v Pirates, Royal BafokengCeltic v Sundowns, Dr Molemela StadiumPolokwane v Maritzburg, Old Peter Mokaba Stadium
