BidVest Wits made it clear that they will not release Phakamani Mahlambi for the national under-20's Africa Cup of Nations in Zambia.Despite the fact that Wits coach Gavin Hunt said he would not be releasing Mahlambi for Amajita's preparation camps a few weeks ago, coach Thabo Senong named the speedy player in his final 21-man squad for the competition.Yesterday Wits chief executive Jose Ferreira said they have written to SAFA to tell them that Mahlambi will not be joining the team for the eight-nation competition, starting this weekend."The competition does not fall under the Fifa calender, so we cannot release the player," said Ferreira. Senong was not available for comment.SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter, meanwhile, has confirmed that he will release goalkeeper Mondli Mpoto and midfielder Teboho Mokoena, who had a good match in the club's 2-1 victory over Elgeco Plus of Madagascar in the CAF Confederation Cup preliminary round on Sunday.Amajita are in Group B Senegal, Sudan and Cameroon, who are the SA's first opponents on Monday.If they finish either first or second in their group, Amajita qualifies for the World Cup in South Korea.U/20 SQUADGOALKEEPERS:Sanele Tshabalala, Mondli Mpoto, Khulekani KubhekaDEFENDERS: Notha Ngcobo, Tercious Malepe, Aghmat Ceres, Siyabonga Ngezana, Katlego Mohamme, Sandile Mthethwa, Thendo MukumelaMIDFIELDERS:Teboho Mokoena, Sipho Mbule, Wiseman Meyiwa, Phakamani Mahlambi, Sibongakonke Mbatha, Kobamelo Kodisang, Grant MargemanSTRIKERS:Itumeleng Shopane, Khanyisa Mayo, Liam Jordan, Luther Singh
