Vincent Aboubakar scored the winner as Cameroon came from behind to beat Egypt 2-1 in the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday. Aboubakar s brilliant finish with two minutes left came just as extra time seemed a certainty at the Stade de l Amitie in Libreville, Gabon. Mohamed Elneny had given Egypt the lead midway through the first half but Nicolas Nkoulou equalised just before the hour mark prior to Aboubakar s winner. It is the fifth time Cameroon have won the Cup of Nations and first since 2002.
