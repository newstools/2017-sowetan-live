Ajax Cape Town youngster Sonwabile Mfecane is to train with Ajax Amsterdam for a month after being hand-picked by the Dutch club s director of football Marc Overmars on a recent visit to the Mother City.The 17-year-old attacking midfielder will spend four weeks in Amsterdam hoping to impress the club s academy coaches and leaves for his new adventure on Sunday.Overmars a former Arsenal and Dutch national team player spotted Mfecane while watching the club s juniors and personally requested he come to Amsterdam so the club can take a closer look. When Marc Overmars came over here he watched two games of his and said I want the number eight he couldn t even say his name. But when he phones me now he says to me where s my number eight? Ajax Cape Town CEO Ari Efstathiou said. So we are very very excited to take him there we just hope he performs well. If he does do well he will come back because he is still under 18 then depending on how they see it he will fly back to Amsterdam [when Mfecane turns 18 in May]. He s a very talented boy if he keeps his feet on the ground he s got a future in football. The Mfuleni-born midfielder is eager to take his big chance and said he felt a responsibility to represent the Cape Town club well to open the door for others. It s a great feeling I feel humbled excited but I know I have a job to do Mfecane said. They told me I have to work hard because it will be a different environment for me and I must keep focused. I must work hard not just for me but for the whole Ajax [Cape Town] youth. Mfecane said his eye for goal is one of his best attributes but he also knows where he needs to improve. Scoring goals for the team at crucial times is my best attribute but I need to work on is my defensive game. The coaches say if I can do that I will be a much better player than I am now. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
