Egypt coach Hector Cuper was apologetic towards the supporters of his side after the Pharaohs threw away the lead to lose 2-1 to Cameroon in Sunday s Africa Cup of Nations final.Egypt had taken a first-half lead in Libreville through Mohamed Elneny but Cameroon levelled the scores in the second half when Nicolas Nkoulou headed in and Vincent Aboubakar then scored a dramatic winner with two minutes to go.The defeat was the latest in a long line of painful final defeats for Cuper in his career the Argentine had notably lost two UEFA Champions League finals with Valencia and a Cup Winners Cup final with Mallorca in the past. Congratulations to Cameroon for the victory. They played well, said the veteran Argentine. The sadness I have is not because I lost another final, it s because there was so much hope especially among the people in Egypt and I am sorry for the players who put in so much effort. We have finished this competition with a defeat but I think they did a great job. I m just sorry that we couldn t give happiness to the people of Egypt because I imagine that there was a lot of expectation among them. I ve lost another final? I m not going to say I m used to it but it s one more for me!
