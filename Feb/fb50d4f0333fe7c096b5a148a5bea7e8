Representatives of the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) have admitted the agency does not have an alternative plan in place to continue paying grant money to 17-million South Africans after the end of March.Sassa and the Department of Social Development accounted to parliament s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) on the ongoing imbroglio related to a contract with Net 1 s Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) which courts ruled was awarded wrongfully.Media reports on Tuesday morning said Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza had been suspended.He was not at Scopa s hearing in parliament but other representatives said he took sick leave on Friday evening and that National Development Agency head Vuyelwa Nhlapo had been appointed acting CEO on Tuesday morning.Scopa members were annoyed that Magwaza had not appeared before the committee some even suggesting the absence was an attempt to avoid accountability.
