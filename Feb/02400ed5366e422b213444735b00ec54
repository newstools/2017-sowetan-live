The grieving mother of a 16-year old boy who collapsed at a Durban gym and died after he suffered a brain aneurysm has shared that the family have decided to donate his organs.Grade 11 Westville Boys High School pupil Bryn Magree collapsed at the Westville Virgin Active gym on Wednesday afternoon and was rushed to hospital. Principal Trevor Hall announced on the school s website on Thursday morning that the Grade 11 pupil had sadly passed on.His mom Janine Magree said via a colleague on Facebook: Thank you all for caring so deeply about our family. At around 3am today we made the heartbreaking decision to donate Bryn s organs as it is the decision Bryn himself might have made were he in a position to do so. The harvesting will be done today probably at Albert Luthuli. She praised staff at King Edward hospital for their fantastic care and treatment. Our son received the best care available from absolutely everyone from Milan the Westville Boys High schoolboy who administered CPR when Bryn fell (his parents have raised a very fine young man) to the unnamed anaesthetist who was quickly on hand the staff at Virgin the paramedics (Dianna and team) and Dr Naidoo Singh and other hospital staff whose names escape us. Fellow pupils had begun a crowdfunding campaign to help Bryn and his family s medical expenses before news of his death. His mother said: Anyone who deposited money in our accounts this will be refunded as soon as it can be organised. We did not expect that and were touched by the incredible generosity of so many people. She concluded her message with a plea: Please allow us the time and space to process and grieve the profound loss we are suffering.
