Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela denied defender Lorenzo Gordinho got himself booked to ensure he is back to face Orlando Pirates in the Soweto derby on March 4.Gordinho was booked in Amakhosi's 1-0 victory over Highlands Park at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday and he'll miss their next match against Ajax Cape Town, before the Soweto derby.Gordinho scored the winner in the first half, taking his tally of league goals to four this season."We are professional and very fair in our processes. 'Tower' [Mulomowandau Mathoho] was suspended today and we did not come with excuses. It was a chance for [Daniel] Cardoso. Gordinho gets suspended and it's a chance for Tower to come back. You sign 32 players, they are your assets and all must be equally capable to play," said Komphela.Amakhosi, who have won five straight matches, are top of the table after their rivals Pirates scored a late goal on Saturday to deny Cape Town City a chance to go to the summit."We are delighted with the result and we are happy for our supporters. They are coming in numbers and they are leaving the stadium with a good feeling. Five matches in a row; we wish we could get more. We should not get satisfied," said Komphela.Highlands coach Gordon Igesund has still only registered one league victory in 13 matches since taking over in October. Even though management have said they support their coach, that's no guarantee that he will finish the season in charge."We have a battle on our hands, it's no secret. We have 12 games left and in those games we need to win five. If you ask me if we are capable of winning five or six games, then I say yes we are," said Igesund. "I don't believe there is a crisis. If we were not playing as well as we are playing, then I would be worried."Highlands, in 15th place, missed out on a few good chances to score against Amakhosi - particularly in the first half when Franklin Cale wasted a one-on-one chance.
