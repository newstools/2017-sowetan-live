It wasn t the chicken that crossed the road but rather chicken stock that lay all across the road.At about 6am on Wednesday morning a truck lost its load and hundreds of boxes and sachets of Benny s chicken stock were strewn on Johannesburg s N3 North near the Marlboro Road exit near Alexandra.Traffic on the highway came at a standstill as three lanes were closed and only remained open.Emer-G-Med paramedics were on the scene but there were no injuries.Spokesman Max Cohen said: There were massive massive traffic delays from the N3 North all the way back to Gillooly s Interchange. Radio 702 s Aki Anastasiou said delays of up to three hours could be expected.Motorists coming from Ekurhuleni were advised to avoid the N3 north and use back roads. - TMG Digital
