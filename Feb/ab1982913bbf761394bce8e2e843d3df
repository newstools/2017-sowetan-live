New Zealand legend Dan Carter revealed Tuesday that luxury car maker Land Rover has dropped him as a brand ambassador after he was caught drink-driving in Paris last week.The two-time Rugby World Cup winner, who plays for defending French champions Racing 92, has already admitted a massive error in judgement over the incident.Carter said he had been holding meetings with sponsors to discuss his actions. Not surprisingly, Land Rover, who for good reason have zero tolerance towards drink driving, have ended their relationship with me, he posted on Facebook. I understand this completely and am disappointed I put them in this position. The 34-year-old has long been regarded as the most marketable athlete in New Zealand and been used to sell everything from underwear to credit cards and air conditioners.Carter was tested at the roadside in Paris last Wednesday night and a police source said his alcohol level was measured at 0.8 grams per litre of blood.He could face penalty points on his driving licence or, if the case goes to court, a fine of 4,500 euros ($4,800) or even a two-year jail sentence.Carter posted over the weekend that he was back in New Zealand and still reflecting on what he had done. (It) was supposed to be a fun pre planned holiday, he wrote on Facebook. Seeing the family again puts fresh perspective on just how big a mistake I made. #dontdrinkanddrive. Carter, a three-time World Player of the Year, is regarded as one of the sport s finest fly-halves and was a World Cup winner with the All Blacks in 2011 and 2015.He is also the sport s record international scorer with 1,598 points in 112 games.Carter began his second playing stint in France after the 2015 World Cup, but it has not been a smooth ride.After his man-of-the-match performance in the Top 14 final in June, he tested positive for corticosteroids, along with fellow former All Black Joe Rokocoko and Argentine winger Juan Imhoff.All three Racing players and the club were later cleared of any wrong-doing by a French Rugby Federation medical commission.But the players have now been summoned to appear before the French Anti-Doping Agency (AFLD) over the incident.
