Libya's transition has been bogged down by insecurity and chaos, leaving the country looking like a "failed state" six years after the Nato-backed uprising that ended Muammar Gaddafi's rule."We got rid of one dictator only to see 10000 others take his place," said Fatma al-Zawi, a Tripoli housewife, bemoaning the multitude of warlords and militias which have run the North African country since the armed revolt of February 2011.Living conditions have deteriorated badly through a combination of insecurity, power cuts, water shortages, cash crunch and the plunging value of the Libyan dinar.Libya's executive and legislative branches have been paralysed by fierce rivalries between political movements."The protagonists don't understood that no single political or tribal clan or movement can govern the country on its own in the post-Gaddafi era," said Rachid Khechana, director of the Mediterranean Centre for Libyan Studies in Tunis."This is why the country is not ready for democratic elections," he said.In the absence of a strong regular army, the oil-rich country's porous borders have turned into a rich terrain for smugglers of arms and people from sub-Saharan Africa desperate to reach Europe via perilous Mediterranean crossings.Also stepping into the void have been jihadists, especially the Islamic State group which has seized swathes of Libya, although it was expelled in December from its bastion of Sirte, a city on the Mediterranean.Hopes for a recovery and return to an era of security raised by a Government of National Accord (GNA) brokered by the United Nations in December 2015 and signed in Morocco, proved short-lived.The GNA, headed by Fayez al-Sarraj, has failed to extend its authority, even in the capital, which is controlled by dozens of militias of shifting allegiances.Meanwhile, in eastern Libya, controversial Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar runs a rival administration with a strong legion of armed forces under him.The general, in his 70s, was overlooked in the Morocco accord but his forces have captured four oil terminals in the east from which most of Libya's oil is exported.Haftar, a sworn foe of Islamist militants, is accused of aiming to establish a dictatorship and has failed to woo Western support.But a rapprochement with Russia and the backing from regional states such as Egypt and the United Arab Emirates are prompting the international community to review its position.The UN envoy to Libya, Martin Kobler, said last week that talks had made progress on "possible amendments" to the December 2015 agreement, and notably on a future role for the military strongman.But analysts remain sceptical over the prospects for Libya to avoid becoming a "failed state"."Libyans must decide whether their country will become a new Somalia, or whether they'll make difficult choices to steer it in a different direction," said Federica Saini Fasanotti, an analyst with the Brookings Institution.
