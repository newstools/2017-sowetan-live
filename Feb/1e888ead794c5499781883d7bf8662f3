In spite of billions in sponsorship pouring into local football, there are still disturbing cases of players retiring broke or dying as paupers.Former Sundowns and Bafana defender Thabiso Rammile is the latest to open up on having nothing to show beyond his playing days."Back then I would blow up R2000 on booze over a weekend, nowadays I budget when I get that kind of money because I have three kids to look after," he was quoted in a soccer magazine.Last year, another former Sundowns and Bafana player, Lovers Mohlala, warned players on his Facebook page not to blow their money but to invest it.Erstwhile Orlando Pirates and Jomo Cosmos defender Lucas Tlhomelang also told how he blew his money partying and snorting cocaine. Former Chiefs darling Thabang Lebese and Sizwe Motaung, the Afcon '96 winning Bafana defender, will mostly be remembered for their final days as sickly and penniless men.Lebese's mom, Florence, last year told how she "didn't get a penny" after her son died in 2012.A tribute from Motaung's best friend Helman Mkhalele during his memorial service told of the former's sad end."Watching my friend in pain and not even having a cent to his name is the saddest memory I have of him ..." Mkhalele told mourners at the time.Jomo Sono had to organise a benefit game in Swaziland for Motaung to raise funds for his medical bills.
