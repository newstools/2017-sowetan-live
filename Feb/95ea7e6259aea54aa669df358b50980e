Australian coach Lisa Alexander has admitted that world netball needs to be a lot more competitive as she praised the Proteas for improving under the guidance of coach Norma Plummer. The number-one ranked Australians beat the fifth-ranked South Africans 62-46 in the third leg of the SANZEA quad series at Durban International Convention Centre on Tuesday night.Despite the victory Alexander says the Proteas gave them a good challenge and hopes they can keep improving on various areas of their game. They did put us under pressure but we still prevailed by 16 goals. It s always tough playing a country on their home turf Alexander said. I think they do need to work on controlling their bodies a bit more. They have become more skilful and they are improving their physical capacities. It s just a matter of being able to play at that level consistently that will improve all of those areas. Norma has worked very hard with the team including their mental toughness and resilience and it s just going to take more time. But they are certainly pushing the top teams which is great because we need world netball to be more competitive. All credit to them they have really improved. Plummer drew positives from the match and was pleased that the Proteas were able to reduce the score from the last time they played Australia. I m fairly pleased. Last time we played them we lost by 25 goals she said. This time we lost by 16 goals and we made a lot of mistakes. But we are in there and the patches of play are coming. We just have to be consistent with it and we are learning the different options on how to get out of certain situations. There s still a lot of work to do. The Proteas will play New Zealand in the fourth leg of the quad series in England on Sunday. - TMG Digital
