Gordon Igesund and his technical team were left hopping mad and exchanged what looked like unpleasant conversations with match officials shortly after Highlands Park were held to a 1-1 draw against Polokwane City on Sunday afternoon. Sipho Jembula scored with virtually the last kick of the match as Polokwane City stole a point away at Premier Soccer League newcomers in a match played in front of a lively crowd at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa.If there is any coach who is living on borrowed time, it has to be Igesund and his alterations with the officials was evidence enough of the pressure he finds himself in. The former Bafana Bafana coach's record since taking over the reigns at Highlands in October is terrible to say the least.Igesund's record now reads seven draws, four defeats and just one win in the 11 matches Igesund has oversaw since replacing sacked Allan Freese in October.Striker Peter Shalulile's goal as early as the 5th minute looked to be enough to hand Park only their third win in 17 matches as the visitors were given a rude awakening.But City shortly got their groove together with captain Jabu Maluleke and winger Tlou Segolela terrorising the Highlands backline.Although the visitors dominated the first half, they went into the break trailing and were never allowed to get back into the match until the last kick of the match with Jembula sliding past a lower shot past Kapini to send the visiting supporters into a frenzy. Rodney Ramagalela should have grabbed a couple of goals for the visitors but was wasteful in front of goal although he had his curving shot from the edge of the box ricocheted off the cross bar and over.Maluleka had the home keeper Tapuwa Kapini worried a few moments later with a testing free kick which went up and over the wall but the Zimbabwean shot stopper was equal to the task as he punched away to safety.Edwin Sitaitai missed a sitter at the other hand after he could only roll his effort inches wide off target with only keeper George Chigova to beat as the Lions of the North went into the half time break with their noses in front. Goal scoring opportunities were few and far in between in the second half as the home side looked content with their slender lead and who can blame them after a horror run of just one win in 11 matches.But celebrations quickly turned into sorrows as Park allowed Jembula ample space inside their own box to snatch a late equaliser for the visitors.City are now winless in four matches after defeats to title contenders Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United and a last gasp midweek draw at home to Maritzuburg United in their last three matches.Luc Eymael's side find themselves stuck in seventh spot on 22 points after 17 matches. City still do look the part to achieve their season goal of finishing inside the top eight bracket. - TMG Digital
