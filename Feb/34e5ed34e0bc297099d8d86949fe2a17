Our vision is to drive the creation of a new T20 destination league in South Africa that would energise the sport of cricket in South Africa by creating a global platform for the best-in-class to perform and showcase their talent to a global audience Nenzani was quoted as saying. We have received a very favourable response to our plans from the ICC and (national) member boards and look to their support in our endeavour. Lorgat was quoted as saying that Early feedback from the marketplace suggests that there is tremendous interest in our (league) from around the globe. This new (league) offers great opportunities for investment in South Africa and South African cricket and we are excited by the number of local and international superstars that will feature in the league. We are also confident that the window we have chosen will make it possible for franchises to attract top class players to South Africa. In South African cricket circles the tournament is seen as a way to ease financial pressures and dissuade players from taking up Kolpak contracts. TMG Digital/TMG Sport
