England's Ben Stokes fetched a staggering $2.17-million (R28m) in the Indian Premier League's (IPL) player auction yesterday, with the Rising Pune Supergiants splashing out in a frenzied bidding war to land the explosive all-rounder.With England hosting South Africa in a one-day series in May, Stokes is set to miss the final phase of the April 5-May 21 tournament, yet the bidding surged from his base price of 20 million rupees (R3.9-million).Pune owner Sanjiv Goenka told reporters that Stokes, now the most expensive overseas player in IPL history, would bring something new to the team for the tournament's 10th edition."He's a complete player and he completes our squad. We've been lacking this one genre of player," he said."We knew he was going to be there for the first 14 games ... We pretty much knew we were not going to get him for below this price."Other big-earners included New Zealand fast bowler Trent Boult and South Africa paceman Kagiso Rabada, who both went for 50 million rupees (R9.8m) to Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils respectively.England's limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan went to Kings XI Punjab for a relatively modest 20 million rupees.Delhi Daredevils bought Australian paceman Pat Cummins for 45 million rupees, while compatriot Mitchell Johnson, who quit international cricket in 2015, returned to his former team Mumbai Indians for 20 million.Owners mostly gave the cold shoulder to slow bowlers, with South African leg-spinner Imran Tahir, who tops both the one-day and Twenty20 bowling rankings, unsold.Mohammad Nabi became the first Afghanistan player to be bought in the IPL with Sunrisers Hyderabad offering three million rupee for the all-rounder. They also bought Afghan leg-spinner Rashid Khan for 40 million rupees.
