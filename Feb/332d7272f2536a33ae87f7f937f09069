South Africa wrapped up the Davis Cup Europe/Africa Group II tie against Estonia 4-1 on Sunday in Irene Pretoria with Wayne Ferreira tipping young Lloyd Harris as a potential star in the making.Harris beat Mattias Siimar 7-5 6-3 on Sunday to finish the weekend unbeaten although SA No.2 Nik Scholtz went down 6-7 (3) 3-6 against his counterpart Vladimir Ivanov.Ferreira a former world No.6 in his day was brought in for the weekend as a consultant by SA skipper Marcos Ondruska. I m very impressed in the abilities of Lloyd Harris in particular he has a good future ahead of him Ferreira said on Sunday adding the 19-year-old still had much to learn. He s still young plays like a young kid. But his fundamentals and shot-wise he s perfect. He s got a good base. He just needs to develop as a player right shot selections working on a couple of things here and there to improve but he definitely has a very bright future. Ondruska who played Davis Cup alongside Ferreira in the 1990s and early 2000s has previously said Harris is destined to make the top 20 in the world.US-based Ferreira said his work and family schedule would determine whether he would be available for the next tie in early April. Slovenia leading Monaco 2-1 looked like the likely opponents which would mean a home tie for SA.He was heartened after informal talks with new Tennis SA chief executive Richard Glover. I think Richard is a very positive man and he has some good ideas and I think he ll probably do a good job. It s still early but I definitely have better feelings about it than I did say a couple of years ago. Ferreira said the federation had made a mistake by not previously tapping into former top players. One year we had 11 guys ranked in the top 100 in the world in doubles there s a lot of resources they could have used I think Richard is very open to bringing those guys back in. A lot of countries do well because they hang onto their past players they get good use out of them. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
