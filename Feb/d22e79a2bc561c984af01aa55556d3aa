Thembinkosi Lorch is hoping that a scorching goal he scored in a friendly for Orlando Pirates against Cape Town City can hold promise of a convincing third return to the Soweto giants for the tricky winger.Lorch has been brought back to Pirates having shown strong signs of maturity in his second loan spell out from the Buccaneers with three goals in 13 appearances and many more assists for Chippa United in the first five months of the 2016-17 season.Signed in 2015 from Maluti FET College the Vodacom League team who famously thrashed Bucs 4-1 in the 2013 Nedbank Cup Lorch had previously been loaned out to Cape Town All Stars in the First Division.It might have been a friendly and one played over three halves of 45 minutes at that but the winger s curled goal against Telkom Knockout champions City at Orlando Stadium last week does appear to hold promise that Lorch is now ready to graduate to being a full-time Buccaneer. I m pleased to be back into the team and I hope to make a meaningful impact Lorch said. The supporters expect nothing but the best from us as players and I will be looking to do all I can to help Pirates. Lorch faces stiff competition from the likes of Thabo Qalinge Thabo Rakahale Luvuyo Memela Riyaad Norodien and Bernard Morrison for a place on Bucs wings. -TMG Digital
