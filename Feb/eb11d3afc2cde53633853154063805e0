The MultiChoice Diski Challenge is approaching its climax and now it's practically a three-horse race.The reserve league title race is hotting up with only three games away.Mamelodi Sundowns, who are at the summit of the log with 28 points, are separated by a single point with Bloemfontein Celtic, while Maritzburg United are not far off the pace at third with 25 points.Maritzburg and Celtic reserves are hoping for young Sundowns to stumble so that they take advantage.The junior Brazilians host eighth-placed Free State Stars at TUT Stadium on Sunday at mid-day.They will once again rely on their star player Keletso Makgalwa for goals although his striking partner Thabang Sibanyoni will miss out after being charged for contravening the PSL rules.Downs used Sibanyoni in their game in December despite the player being rendered ineligible having accumulated four yellow cards and he was supposed to serve a one-match suspension. Now the club has been hauled before the PSL tribunals.Meanwhile, Celtic reserves will take on Orlando Pirates at Rand Stadium tomorrow morning.
