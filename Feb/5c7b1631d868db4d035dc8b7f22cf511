In their debrief, Platinum Stars coach Cavin Johnson and his Orlando Pirates counterpart Augusto Palacios will lament the fact that their 0-0 stalemate was two points dropped than the one gained.Pirates went into this match sitting tenth position on the log and Wednesday night proceedings ended with them trailing log-leaders SuperSport United by a whooping nine points and faced with a mountain to climb to refresh their title aspirations.For Stars, they moved one place to 12th, largely because Mamelodi Sundowns beat Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 in one of the Wednesday s four matches in Mangaung but Johnson would have preferred maximum points to close the gap with 11th placed Ajax Cape Town.It does not get any better for Pirates as they have a daunting trip to traditional rivals Sundowns in Pretoria on Saturday afternoon where failure to get maximum points will pile more pressure on Palacios.Stars have time to correct their mistakes as their next league match is on Wednesday away to bottom of the log Baroka FC where they will fancy their chances of collecting maximum points.In this match, the two teams enjoyed a fair share of possession where they played attacking football but created few goalmouth opportunities to test the goalkeepers.One of the early opportunities fell for Pirates captain Oupa Manyisa whose shot from outside the box was saved by Stars goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela.For Stars, an opportunity went begging as striker Bonginkosi Ntuli lacked support after he was found in possession in the opposition s danger where he was outnumbered by the Pirates defenders.Ntuli was again a thorn in the Pirates defence a few minutes later but he could not cause damage as he was thwarted by Pirates defender Happy Jele inside the box in the 25th minute.The earlier opportunities by Ntuli injected belief into Stars and they attacked Pirates again but captain Vuyo Mere could only watch in disappointment as his wayward shot sailed over the crossbar.Pirates launched a quick attack of their own after the Stars scare with striker Tendai Ndoro feeding midfielder Mpho Makola whose tame effort was dealt with by Mzimela.Palacios made an early substitution by replacing defensive midfielder Issa Sarr and introduced attack minded winger Abbubaker Mobara in the 34th minute but the former Ajax Cape Town could not influence proceedings in their favour.Five minutes after restart, Robert Ng ambi forced an acrobatic save from Pirates goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo with a close range snap shot as the score remained goalless.Pirates appealed for a penalty moments later when Luvuyo Memela went down in the box following a tough tackle from Sphamandla Mlilo but referee Olani Kwindo waved play on.Pirates could have taken the lead in the 67th minute but Thabo Matlaba could only managed the side netting and the two teams continued to attack each other in the closing stages but had to settle for the share of the spoils.TMG Digital
