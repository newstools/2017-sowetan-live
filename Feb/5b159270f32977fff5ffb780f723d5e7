SuperSport United extended their unbeaten run in the Absa Premiership to 14 games, but Free State Stars deserved more than a 0-0 draw at James Motlatsi Stadium in Orkney on Wednesday night.Stars went into the game in second-last place having come back from the PSL's six-week break with a 3-1 defeat away against Kaizer Chiefs.But Serame Letsoaka s second match in charge would have given Ea Lla Koto far more hope of avoiding relegation in 2016-17, even if they have much work left to do.Stars were well organised, hungry and played to a good tempo, largely dominating SuperSport off the park. They needed a win desperately, but were left with the consolation that if they can maintain this level of performance, the points will come.Letsoaka s men could not have known how they went to the break without a lead. They were the industrious team of the first half and dynamic in attack, pinning SuperSport back and striking the wookdwork twice, though Matsatsantsa did once.Moeketsi Sekola and Mohamed Anas, with a spectacular 30-metre drive, hit the crossbar for Stars in the opening 10 minutes.Morgan Gould's header from a free-kick looped onto the bar at the other end soon after.It was Stars who continued to push for the opening goal, as influential playamker Danny Venter curled a shot wide.Stars opened SuperSport in a counter-attack as Mohamed Anas forced a solid save from goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse and Makhehlene Makhaula hit the rebound wide.Venter's skill and low cross forced Clayton Daniels to almost score an own goal, his backward touch finding Pieterse on the ground. Pieterse's one-handed save kept out Anas's header just before the break.From the change rooms United, as a quality side will do, tightened up markedly. After the fist-half let-off they were content to play conservatively, while keeping an eye out to sneak something more than a point.It took until the 78th minute for Anas to test Pieterse again. Sekola forced another save from the on-song keeper in injury time, with Anas hitting the rebound over.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
