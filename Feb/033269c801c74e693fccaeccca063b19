While Underberg farmer Trevor Rees continues to fight for his life in hospital new details of the torture at the hands of his attackers have emerged.Rees was discovered by employees on his farm Pudsey in the southern Drakensburg early on Monday after he was bound and beaten by robbers over two days.It has also since emerged that Rees had been shot twice in the attack.Brett Deavin of Berg Protection Services said that since Rees was found in his home other details of what the farmer endured had surfaced. We think that when they tried to ram down the wall with the tractor he had hidden in a cupboard. When they got inside they found him and badly assaulted him he said. It appears that they used a set of pliers to pinch his skin and they also poured Jik down his throat Deavin added.The attack on Rees is the second violent farm robbery in the area in less than a week.Last week farmer Gavin Carter was gunned down in his home by three men in an apparent robbery on his farm West Ilsley. Right now he is touch and go. He is very critical Deavin said of Rees. He said that Rees s dog had been killed in the week before he was attacked. TMG Digital
