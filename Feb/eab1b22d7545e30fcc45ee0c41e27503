With nationwide praise still ringing in his ears KwaZulu-Natal education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana continued his department s distribution of sanitary pads of schoolgirls from poor families.On Thursday morning Dlungwana was at Lamontville High School and said the programme was aimed at ensuring that girls did not miss school.According to a department spokesman some girls would miss a month of classroom time over the course of the year because they could not afford pads. As the Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal we want to ensure that girl learners in KwaZulu-Natal will not have to miss school simply because they are menstruating said Dlungwana.
