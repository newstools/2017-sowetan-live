Heinrich Klaasen's absence at the Titans training session while Heino Kuhn and Rivaldo Moonsamy took turns with the gloves fuelled suspicion that the up and coming Titans wicketkeeper will be named in the test squad for the New Zealand series.While the Knights' Rudi Second staked a claim with his 684 Sunfoil Series runs at 52.61 putting him seventh on the top run-makers list the 25-year-old from Pretoria is just behind Second with 635 runs at 48.84.Second made more hundreds (three) as compared to Klaasen (one) but it's seemingly the lower-order impact that may have trumped Second's top-order stability.Either way Titans coach Mark Boucher seemed like he was preparing for life without his number one stumper by putting the proven Kuhn and the raw but talented Moonsamy through their paces.Boucher confirmed Kuhn will be keeping in their Momentum 1-Day Cup clash with against the Cape Cobras at Newlands on Friday. One thing I do know is that I'll need to press Heino into keeping service on Friday but at least I do have Morne Morkel and Lungi Ngidi available for the Friday game " Boucher said."Ngidi picked up a bit of a niggle which has forced him to miss practice but we'll be monitoring him. I think the guys were a bit rusty on Friday because of the short turnover from the four-day game to the limited overs stuff so the death bowling did let us down."We did let Robbie Frylinck play well but I think we could've had better game plans to him."We played decent cricket throughout the game bar the last five overs. Moonsamy was one of the bright sparks in Friday's efficient batting effort which was eclipsed by Frylinck's record breaking pyrotechnics.Fresh from the Lawrence Mahatlane Under-19 school with decent amateur service for the Northerns Boucher likes what he sees in the 20-year-old who made an exciting 46-ball 68. Rivaldo knows his game fairly well as a batsman and he's played a fair bit of amateur cricket but we mustn't expect too much from the youngsters who are coming in."They are still finding their feet but what we got from Rivaldo in his first match was magnificent and an absolute bonus for us. We just want the youngsters to come in and play with freedom Boucher said. Hopefully some of the older guys can feed off the exuberance the youngsters bring in because it's fantastic. I want Rivaldo to play with freedom as a batter but his keeping still needs some work and he understands that. - TMG Digital
