Kaizer Motaung has explained why his team were not aggressive in the transfer market and only signed one player, Gustavo Paez.Kaizer Chiefs were linked with a host of players in the January transfer window, which raised expectations among their supporters.Chiefs, though, only roped in Paez, who joined as a free agent and Motaung has now weighed in on the subject of signing players."I believe that if teams know what they are doing, there shouldn't be a lot of activity in the middle of the season," said Motaung yesterday from Naturena, where the club announced a three-year partnership with vehicle manufacturer Toyota."You only go to the market once your setup is not up to scratch, and you need obviously to plug some gaps to be able to either survive or you are in the driver's seat but you need to plug one or two gaps," he said."For me, the window period in January doesn't excite me because it just tells you that people who run into that space were not organised in the beginning of the season. So that's why we only decided to sign one player," Motaung shared.The Chiefs owner is confident that Paez, who made his debut in Chiefs' 3-1 win over Free State Stars on Tuesday, will be a hit."Apart from the fact that the technical team was impressed, I was impressed myself. I saw him play one or two of the friendly matches that we played."He looked like he's got the qualities, the technique and the skills to play as a striker. The little bit that I saw looked quite impressive and in fact, he's a player with a good football brain and he makes very good runs. Given a chance, I think he would not disappoint us," he said.Motaung, however, was cautious when asked about the team's chances of winning silverware considering there is a prospect of them finishing empty handed for the second season in a row."Well, like any other club in the league, our target is to win all the remaining games to achieve something and that is the target."But it doesn't necessarily mean that when you put a target you would achieve it," he said.On their partnership with Toyota, Motaung revealed that this will save the club millions."Presently, we were hiring cars and I think we must have been spending R3-million a year, so it is a saving in that respect."Toyota will supply the club with 20 vehicles to meet their transportation requirements for three years. These include hatchbacks, sedans, SUVs, bakkies and minibuses.
