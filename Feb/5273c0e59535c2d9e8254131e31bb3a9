President Jacob Zuma said in his state of the nation address that it would be difficult if not impossible to achieve true reconciliation until the land question is resolved.According to state statistics only 8-million hectares of arable land had been transferred to black people which was only 9.8% of the 82-million hectares of arable land in South Africa.Zuma bemoaned the fact that there had been a 19% decline in households involved in agriculture from 2.9-million in 2011 to 2.3-million households in 2016.Although government wanted to use the Expropriation Act to pursue land reform and land redistribution it had to refer the bill back to Parliament on the basis that the bill might not pass constitutional muster due to inadequate public participation during its processing.EFF s warning to Parliament s bouncers: We are going to beat the bastards He admitted that the reopening of land claims was also still on hold because the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act of 2014 was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court.Government will continue to implement other programmes such as the Strengthening of Relatives Rights programme also known as the 50-50 programme.In this programme farm workers join together into a legal entity and together with a farm owner a new company is established and the workers and the owner become joint owners.Beyond the fisticuffs - 5 things from Zuma's SONA speech you need to know Zuma appealed to land claimants to accept land instead of financial compensation. Over 90% of claims are currently settled through financial compensation which does not help the process at all. It perpetuates dispossession. It also undermines economic empowerment he said.
