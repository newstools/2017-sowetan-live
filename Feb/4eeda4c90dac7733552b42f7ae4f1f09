South Africa lost the second one-day international against New Zealand to level the series in Christchurch yesterday, but AB de Villiers liked some of what he saw.Most of it came from the newer members of his team like Dwaine Pretorius, who took 2/40 and scored a stirring 50 that came close to changing the result.Andile Phehlukwayo, too, provided further evidence that he belongs at this level in a stand of 61 with Pretorius."It's great to see them play with confidence and with a bit of freedom," De Villiers told reporters in Christchurch."It tells a story about our culture within the team."The guys are really freed up and they feel they can just watch the ball and enjoy the cricket."They are fully backed by all the older guys and the management."I was pretty impressed with some of the younger guys. I thought Dwaine also bowled really well for us."The depth looks really good and the future looks bright."So much for the positives.New Zealand totalled 289/4 but won by just six runs, and thereby hangs a tale of missed opportunities by South Africa's batsmen.Instead, only four batsmen reached 30 and Quinton de Kock's 57 was South Africa's top score. We bat to 10 but the top five and top six still have to take the responsibility to be there at the end," De Villiers, who scored 45, said.South Africa will have the chance to fix those problems in the third match of the series in Wellington on Saturday. - TMG Digital
