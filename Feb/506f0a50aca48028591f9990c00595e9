After Thapelo Morena bagged a brace against Orlando Pirates at the weekend, Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane could be tempted to play the 23-year-old in a more advanced position against Chippa United tonight.Morena was moved from right-back to the right wing when Anele Ngcongca was brought on midway through the second half of Down's 6-0 demolition of Pirates and it worked like a charm.The former Bloemfontein Celtic man first hit the upright after rounding Bucs goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane, but he redeemed himself with two tap-ins, thanks to some unselfish work from teammates who laid the ball for him to easily finish. It was a taste of how dangerous Morena can be when he is given more freedom to attack.Morena described his two goals in the hammering of Pirates as a "dream come true" and he's itching for more opportunities to play as a right winger, where he can get into those good scoring positions in the opposition half.His combination with Percy Tau was a delight to watch, so this is something Mosimane could look at as an option going forward."It was good because it's the position I enjoy playing in. The moment I went from right-back to right wing, I hit the bar and scored two goals. This is something I have been waiting for. I would like to see myself scoring more," said Morena, ahead of the Brazilians' meeting with ninth-placed Chippa at Siza Dukashe Stadium at 7.30pm.In their 1-0 victory at Celtic and 6-0 win over disjointed Bucs in the past few days, Downs showed both their ability to grind out a result and turn on the style.Sundowns, in fifth place, are just six points behind leaders Cape Town City, with six matches in hand.Before leaving for East London yesterday, Sundowns had a video analysis and a light training session to prepare for their tricky opponents.
