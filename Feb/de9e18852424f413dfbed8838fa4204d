Cracks are beginning to appear in the "Premier League" after Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza yesterday criticised his Free State counterpart Ace Magashule for punting him for the position of deputy president of the ANC, saying it was "uncalled for".The "Premier League" is a group of ANC provincial chairmen supportive of President Jacob Zuma - which are the North West, Free State and Mpumalanga premiers.However, it is understood that there are differences over preferences for various positions among this group before the ANC holds its elective conference in December.Zuma has effectively come out in support of former AU Commission chairwoman and his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to succeed him as president of the ANC.There is behind-the-scenes jostling for the position of deputy president, and over the weekend Free State ANC chairman Magashule told party members that if they wanted Mabuza as the next deputy president, they should elect him.Magashule was in Mpumalanga for the funeral of Mabuza's brother.Speaking at a media briefing yesterday, Mabuza described Magashule's comments as "uncalled for".He said the ANC had decided not to openly name candidates but to focus on policy instead.He urged people not to use his name to bypass ANC rules."As the ANC we have taken a decision to not discuss names ... let's talk about important issues like what we have done and what we need to do. Yes, people have a right to talk and discuss [about] my name and I will not respond because they are talking about me, not with me."I do not have to respond to the premier of Free State. All I can tell him is that he should not break the rules of the ANC in my name ...," Mabuza said.Magashule's spokesman Tiisetso Makhele said he could only comment on issues relating to government and not the ANC succession debate.Makhele referred Sowetan to ANC provincial spokesman Thabo Meeko who could not be reached last night.Meanwhile, Mabuza also revealed yesterday his province had taken a decision to support the families of the three Lily Mine victims - Pretty Nkambule, Yvonne Mnisi and Solomon Nyerende - whose bodies are still trapped in the mine since February 5 last year."On the Lily Mine issue, I met with the mine and the Minister of Mineral Resources [Mosebenzi Zwane] to discuss the way forward ... The mine pleaded it did not have money hence it is on business rescue. As government, we have taken it upon ourselves that we will support the families of the three victims." - Additional reporting by Mcelwa Nchabeleng
