Premier Soccer League (PSL) officials are taking no chances and unprecedented security measures will be in place at FNB stadium when Kaizer Chiefs host rivals Orlando Pirates in the Soweto Derby on Saturday afternoon.PSL safety and security head Phillip Masimong told Times Media Digital on Monday they had to beef up security to prevent the likelihood of a repeat of the violent scenes that marred a league game between Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus almost three weeks ago. It could not be business as usual after what happened at Loftus Masimong said. What happened at Loftus was a lesson and we are ready for the Soweto Derby on Saturday. Angry supporters made their feelings known and stormed the pitch as Sundowns continued to wipe the floor with Pirates en route to an embarrassing 6-0 humiliation at Loftus.Fights broke out and an armoured police vehicle drove onto the pitch in one of the most dramatic scenes seen in the PSL.Stadium seats were angrily ripped up and visuals on TV were interrupted when cables were forcefully pulled out by incensed fans.The game was disrupted for a long period in the second half before order was finally restored allowing the match to be played to its conclusion.Masimong said there would be an increased security presence and police security personnel and plain-clothed operatives would be deployed inside and outside of the 2010 Soccer World Cup venue.Crime intelligence operatives in Chiefs and Pirates shirts would also take their places in the stands like normal fans and look out for signs of trouble.Several meetings have been held over the last few days and representatives from the PSL Chiefs Pirates police the stadium transport and medical services among many others have shared information ahead of the biggest fixture in Southern Africa. I know that people were worried after what happened but we have taken everything into account during our planning. The game should be sold out by Saturday as it will have the added attraction of a new coach on the Pirates bench.Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza raised eyebrows when he appointed the little-known Kjell Jonevret last Monday and all eyes will be on the Swede in his first Soweto derby.Jonevret gave indication that he knows exactly what will be at stake at FNB as he was already talking up the game moments after his appointment last week.The two sides will go into the game on the back of drawn matches Chiefs drew 1-1 with Ajax Cape Town on Saturday while Pirates registered the same result against Polokwane City also on the same day and it remains to be seen if Jonevret and his Chiefs counterpart Steve Komphela will throw caution to the wind and go for the jugular.While the 10-placed Pirates trail the fourth-ranked Chiefs by a massive 13 points current form and previous results usually do not mean a lot when it comes to the Soweto Derby.
