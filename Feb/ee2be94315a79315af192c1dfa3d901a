Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane and his deputy Godfrey Oliphant each spent over R1.3-million on luxury vehicles in the past four months.Zwane bought a luxurious Mercedes-Benz S400 for R1.35-million.His spokesman Martin Madlala said the car was bought this month.Oliphant had earlier got himself a Porsche Cayenne that cost the taxpayer about R1.33-million from Porsche South Africa in November.The purchases occurred despite Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan announcing months earlier that politician's cars would be capped at R750000.National Treasury supported both purchases and approved the deviations from normal supply chain processes, according to documents seen by Sowetan.Both Zwane and Oliphant were allowed to buy the vehicles because National Treasury's transversal contract did not offer the cars they preferred.The former Free State agriculture MEC's new car was bought from Mercedes-Benz SA.The transversal contract, which lists nearly 1500 vehicles, for the purchase of state cars allowed the government to buy from different suppliers at fixed prices.Madlala said vehicles were vital tools required for political heads to function and perform their duties which required extensive travel.He said the Ministerial Handbook was used for purchasing vehicles."The rules in this regard are clear," Madlala said. He said Zwane used vehicles hired from the government's fleet management service g-Fleet since he joined the department after President Jacob Zuma's reshuffle in 2015.According to Madlala, the vehicle used by Zwane's predecessor Ngoako Ramatlhodi, now the public service and administration minister, was older than five years and had done more than 200000km.Departments may purchase official vehicles directly from manufacturers or dealerships only when the current official vehicle for that office has reached 120000km or five years, whichever comes first."The vehicles used by both the minister and the deputy minister had reached this stage," Madlala said.He confirmed that Zwane was granted permission by National Treasury to purchase vehicles for himself and Oliphant.Last year, Gordhan announced stringent cost containment measures to limit the value of vehicle purchases for political office bearers.Shortly after Zuma came into office in 2009, it was revealed that members of his cabinet had splurged millions of rand on luxury vehicles.Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande bought a R1.1-million seven series BMW.Then communications minister Siphiwe Nyanda bought two BMW 750i which cost R1.135-million each for use in Pretoria and the other in Cape Town.National Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. sidimbal@ sowetan.co.za
