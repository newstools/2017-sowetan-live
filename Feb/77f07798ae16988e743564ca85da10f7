They might be coming off a long festive season break and positioned at opposite ends of the Absa Premiership table but there will be a quiet desperation for both Cape Town City and Highlands Park when they meet at Cape Town Stadium on Tuesday night.City started December with a magnificent victory in the Telkom Knockout final against SuperSport United but since then have taken just a single point from three league games and looked well below their best.Local rivals Ajax Cape Town went on a nine-game winless run after the high of claiming the MTN8 title in 2015 and City coach Eric Tinkler will be all to wary of falling into the same complacent trap.City start the New Year level on points with SuperSport United and Bidvest Wits at the top of the table but have played a game more than the former and two matches extra compared to the latter.Highlands Park spent some of their festive season break down campaign in Cape Town which gave Tinkler a good look at them. I watched Highlands play a couple of friendlies in Cape Town last month so I have an idea what to expect he said. They re fighting for their lives and I m expecting a tough battle. Highlands Park start 2017 in the relegation play-off position and tinkered in the transfer window without really bringing in the kind of quality that you would expect to see them shooting up the table.Defensively they were very poor in the first half of the campaign conceding almost two goals a game and unless they can stem the flow they could face a quick return to the National First Division.That will be easier said than done against a slick City side who when on form are among the best attacking forces in the South African top-flight.The Gauteng side have signed Namibia international Chris Katjiukua Siyabonga Nhlapo on loan from BidVest Wits and Nigerian defender Ayo Oluwafemi formerly with Jomo Cosmos in attempt to sure things up at the back.Highlands have won just one of their last 14 league games which is relegation form but with a New Year comes fresh hope that they can pull away from the danger zone.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
