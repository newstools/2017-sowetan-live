Baxter and his side will return home for an away Absa Premiership fixture against Free State Stars on Wednesday.Baxter said he would rotate the squad after their 5-2 win over Golden Arrows in midweek."We've got the Madagascar trip. So we will make a few changes in Madagascar, but that won't be because we are underestimating people. It will be because with the schedule we've got, we can't just pick the same XI all the time. The [whole] squad has got to take responsibility," Baxter said.The Tshwane side has been hit by injuries to many players this season, including Jeremy Brockie, Bradley Grobler, Tefu Mashamaite, Grant Kekana and Fagrie Lakay."I think the squad deserves a massive pat on the back. They've made it through the first half of the season with all these injuries. A lot of our frontliners have been out."New signing Mandla Masango is not part of the travelling squad because he is not yet registered for the CAF club competition.
