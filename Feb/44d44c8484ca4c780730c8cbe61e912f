Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo is a wanted man.A warrant of arrest for the footsie was authorised at the Randburg Magistrate's Court on January 27 after he missed his court appearance.Khuzwayo, 27, was scheduled to appear in court after he was arrested for allegedly interfering with police duties in December.Sunday World reported at the time that the KwaZulu-Natal-born player tried to use his star power and goalkeeping to hold back police as they tried to arrest his friend at his home in the luxurious Dainfern estate.He was detained at the Douglasdale police station and made his first appearance at the Randburg Magistrate's Court seven days later when the matter was remanded to January 27.A R1500 bail was set.According to official documents seen by Sowetan, the goalie failed to appear in court last month, prompting a warrant of his arrest to be authorised by the court on February 1.The document states that Khuzwayo allegedly missed court because he was sick.However, his warrant would appear not to be an urgent matter because when Sowetan contacted him earlier yesterday, he was in training with his team.Club spokesman Vina Maphosa said the club was not aware of any warrant of arrest out in Khuzwayo's name."We are not aware of anything. A player informs us of things happening in their private lives if they need our aid in anything but at this point I am not aware of anything in regards to him as he is currently at camp in training but did not tell us anything. Anyway, I am not allowed to comment on any personal matters involving players," he said.Police spokesman Kay Makhubele said the court gave the goalie 10 days (expiring on Friday) to explain why he missed his court date.madibogoj@sowetan.co.za
