Three of South Africa s four representatives in African club competition this year get their campaigns under way this weekend with only African Champions League holders Mamelodi Sundowns given a bye from the preliminary round of competition.But for BidVest Wits in the Champions League and SuperSport United and Platinum Stars in in the Confederation Cup it is all systems go.Each will expect to advance to the next round but will know little about their opponents. Times Media Digital gives the lowdown on who they will face.BIDVEST WITS VS SAINT-LOUISIENNE (REUNION) Remarkably Saint-Louisienne from the tiny island of Reunion have tasted some rich success against South African teams in the past including knocking giants Mamelodi Sundowns out of the Champions League in 1999!The teams clashed in a two-legged second round tie and after playing to a 1-1 draw in Pretoria the islanders triumphed 4-2 against the South African champions in the home leg for what must remain arguably their greatest moment in CAF competitions.They also met Pirates in the same competition three years later but this time the South African side won though not by much as they claimed a 2-1 home success and then triumphed 2-0 away.They also played Pretoria City (now SuperSport United) in the African Cup Winners Cup in 1996 but received a right old thrashing with an 8-1 aggregate success for the South Africans.The club was formed in 1936 and play at the Stade Th ophile Hoarau which can hold a meager 2 500 fans.The did make the semifinals of the Cup Winners Cup in 1997 and 2000 and also appeared in the group stages of the Champions League the same year they ousted Sundowns a remarkable triumph for the plucky club.They managed a joint record 17th Reunion Premier League title in 2016. SUPERSPORT UNITED VS ELGECO PLUS ALFA SuperSport take on Madagascan side Association Sportive Saint-Michel Elgeco Plus in the Confederation Cup and have never before played against Malagasy opposition though South African teams have fared surprisingly poorly against teams from the island in the past.Mamelodi Sundowns were ousted from the Champions League in 2006 by USCAFOOT on the away goals rule after a 1-1 draw away and 2-2 stalemate at home while BidVest Wits were beaten Leopards Transfoot (2004 on away goals rule) and AS Adema (2011 on a 3-1 aggregate score).Kaizer Chiefs led US Transport 4-0 from the home leg of the 2002 Confederation Cup but were disqualified after failing to pitch for the return leg citing ironically transport issues.Elgeco finished runners-up in Madagascar last season and have not played a competitive fixture since then end of November. Not that SuperSport have had it much better with the long festive season break in South Africa.The islanders were ousted in the preliminary round of both the 2014 and 2015 Confederation Cup by rather confusingly Saint-Michel United from the Seychelles and Uganda Revenue Authority respectively. PLATINUM STARS VS UNI O DESPORTIVA DO SONGO Stars make a return to continental competition for the first time since 2008 and will hope for a big first leg lead against Uni o Desportiva Do Songo to take back to Maputo a week later.As Songo are from the far north of Mozambique with limited travel access the home leg for the team will instead be played in the country s capital a fact that will suit Stars.Songo have only been in existence since 2002 and are appearing in CAF competition for the first time having been crowned the country s cup winners in 2016.South African teams have generally done OK against sides from Mozambique in the past tasting defeat in a tie just once.That was when Jomo Cosmos lost 4-0 on aggregate to Costa do Sol in the 2003 Cup Winners Cup. Songo have not had a competitive fixture since the end of October when the league in Mozambique finished.TMG Digital
