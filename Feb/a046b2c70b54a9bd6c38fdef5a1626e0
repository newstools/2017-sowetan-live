Cosatu wants authorities to place Cape Town on a drip system and for swimming pool water to be returned to dams.The union federation said the shortage would lead to the poor dying of thirst while the rich would be able to buy water at the shops .Cosatu took the city to task for the way it had handled the crisis: The steps the city is taking have failed; the rich have more than enough money to pay fines and expensive water bills. The steps have not led to the required decline in water usage. The federation provided a list of demands including:- No water for pools gardens or cars;- All taps should be put on a drip system across Cape Town ;- Setting up desalination plants to make the sea water drinkable ;- Access to aquifers and- All swimming pool water must be returned to the dams in tanks .
