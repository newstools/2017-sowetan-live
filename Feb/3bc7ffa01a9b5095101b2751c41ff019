Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane will be using the Absa Premiership match against Orlando Pirates to prepare for next week's CAF Super Cup against DRC giants TP Mazembe.A victory over the Buccaneers would give the African champions the boost they need to face the Confederation Cup champions, as they continue to get back to full fitness after taking a longer break than most teams in January. It would also move them closer to the top of the domestic table, where their Tshwane rivals SuperSport United currently sit.Sundowns, who host Pirates at Loftus tomorrow (3.30pm), were made to work hard for their 1-0 victory over Bloemfontein Celtic on Wednesday, while the Buccaneers were lacklustre in a goalless draw with Platinum Stars. "We got the result [against Celtic] and we know it's going to be difficult against Pirates. But we have the experience. If it's 1-0, then we will take the 1-0. You know when they play Sundowns at Loftus, they always give us a tough time," Downs coach Pitso Mosimane said. "We will use these two games against Celtic and Pirates to prepare for the Super Cup against Mazembe."Sundowns will be without suspended Wayne Arendse, but the availability of versatile Anele Ngcongca gives Mosimane an option of playing the experienced defender in central defence. Bangaly Soumahoro and Thabo Nthethe are also capable replacements to play alongside Ricardo Nascimento.Hlompho Kekana and Tiyani Mabunda, both on three yellow cards, avoided suspension and will give Sundowns the man power they need in midfield. Algerian left-back Fares Hachi made his debut against Celtic and is likely to feature tomorrow."Mzi Mashaba is injured again, so Fares came at the right time when I did not have a left-back (Tebogo Langerman is also injured)," said Mosimane.Pirates are without a win since November. Against Stars on Wednesday, they did not have a shot on target and top scorer Tendai Ndoro was not given the service he needs to make an impact.
