The SA Football Association (Safa) could announce both the Bafana Bafana and Banyana Banyana coaches after this week's national executive committee meeting.While the court battle with axed Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba continues, Safa is looking for someone to occupy the hot seat and an announcement from the association is imminent.Safa president Danny Jordaan is back from Gabon, where he was part of the CAF organising committee, to chair the NEC meeting on Saturday and the Bafana coach will be high on the agenda as they look to have someone to take Bafana through the CHAN, 2019 Africa Cup of Nations and 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifiers.Desiree Ellis has been in charge of Banyana Banyana as an interim since the departure of Vera Pauw. She steered the side to a fourth place finish at the African Women's Championship in Cameroon and recently lost 2-0 to France in an international friendly.The former Banyana skipper is keen to prove herself in the job and she's hoping they give her a chance to do that, though Safa may cast their net wide. There are no major qualifiers for the senior women's team this year, so whoever takes over will get ample time to build a solid team.SA, meanwhile, will host the entire Confederation of African Football (CAF) executive, including president Issa Hayatou next week.They will be in the country to watch the CAF Super Cup final between Mamelodi Sundowns and TP Mazembe at Lucas Moripe Stadium on February 18 (7pm kickoff).
