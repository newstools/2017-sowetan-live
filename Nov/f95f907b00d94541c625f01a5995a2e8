Much like fashion seasons - it's out with "Gucci Grace" and in with ... well, time will tell. As Zimbabweans gear up for the inauguration of their new president Emmerson Mnangagwa, bets are being taken for who will step in the fashionable shoes of Grace Mugabe. While all eyes are on the actual first lady, Auxillia Mnangagwa, close on her heels is Marry Chiwenga, 34, the young wife of General Constantino Chiwenga, who was instrumental in toppling Robert Mugabe and might be in line to be deputy president. With her shapely long legs and polished fashion sense, she is sure to turn her appearances into catwalk moments. The former Miss Zimbabwe and Supermodel finalist married the general in 2010 after Chiwenga divorced his first wife Jocelyn Mauchaza. Chiwenga is reported to have paid $47 000 in lobola and had been dating retired Zimbabwe international footballer Shingi Kawondera before opting for the barracks. Auxillia, 54, on the other hand, seems to be a fan of African prints and fashion best described as "mother of the bride couture". Perhaps age appropriate and muted for a country battling economic woes, it's almost guaranteed that antics like Grace's posh shopping sprees in fashion capitals of the East, US and Europe will be missed on Zimbabwe fashion scene. Auxillia is the third wife of Mnangagwa. She holds a Master's degree and remains rooted in tradition. It was recently reported that she delivered a thank you speech on her knees to Mugabe for giving her husband the vice-presidency job as a sign of respect, that was before Mugabe fired him. Hard to imagine the svelte Marry doing such with her expensive Brazilian weave and trendy threads. Whatever happens, the fashion gods will have their hands full as they pit Marry and Auxillia together - somehow an unfair competition.
