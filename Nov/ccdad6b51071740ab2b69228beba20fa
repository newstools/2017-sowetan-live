November 21 2017 marked a historic moment when long-time Zimbabwean ruler Robert Mugabe relinquished power after a military intervention. The situation is a bit complicated because Mugabe might have negotiated his exit conditions under pressure, after being fired by his own Zanu-PF party. Another time bomb waiting to explode is the DRC, where a sitting president is using all means to stay in power after his term of office expired. Joseph Kabila took over the presidency in 2001 after his father Laurent was killed by his bodyguards. The Congolese people have failed to remove him from power, and it is the duty of SADC and AU to do that before the country plunges into a civil war. Lesego Shabangu, Soshanguve
