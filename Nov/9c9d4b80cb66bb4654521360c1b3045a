Mamelodi Sundowns promising centre-back Thendo Mukumela, 19, is positive that he will eventually feature for the first team after he was promoted at the start of the season. Since he was drafted into the senior side, Mukumela has found opportunities hard to come by. "I am adamant that I will make my senior debut this season," he said. "Once I get that opportunity, I will make sure that I grab it with both hands. "I am listening to coach Pitso Mosimane every time he talks to me. He told me that I should wait for my opportunity... it will eventually come." Mukumela said he learnt a lot from other defenders, including Motjeka Madisha and Wayne Arendse. "I do not take them as competition; they're helping me to settle in the first team." Mukumela is currently in camp with the SA U/20 national team, gearing up for the Cosafa Youth Championships to be hosted by Zambia from next Wednesday to Saturday. "We want to win this [Cosafa] tournament; last year we lost in the final [2-1 to Zambia in Rustenburg]. We have now improved a lot and we have studied how other African nations are playing."  Amajita open their campaign on Thursday against Mozambique in Kitwe.
