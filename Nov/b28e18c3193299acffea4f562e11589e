Ex-Orlando Pirates marksman Jerry Sikhosana believes there should be striker coaches to address the goalscoring problem in the country. There have been so many draws in the Absa Premiership that some have even mocked the PSL, calling it the Premier Draw League. Six games ended goalless in the last 14 Premiership fixtures over the past week. Sikhosana, who was deadly in front of goal in his heyday, said it's high time former strikers were considered to coach the current crop. "With the crisis we have, we should be having people who coach strikers," Sikhosana said. "Where are we lacking now? It's in attack, so can't we have people who can come in and specialise in that department? We need to have people like myself, and I'm not saying I'm the best, but we also have people like Phil [Masinga]. This is a crisis. "I'm happy to see PSL coaches like Benni [McCarthy] and Fadlu Davids, people who used to be strikers. "We play good football and it shows in other departments that we are improving, but it's only just to put the ball in the back of the net." To date, 168 goals have been scored in 172 league matches, which is less than a goal per match. Sikhosana said goals bring people to the stadium. "People just don't want to see teams having ball possession. They want to see goals and that's all that matters," he continued. Meanwhile, former Bafana Bafana striker Masinga said PSL teams were "so cautious, waiting for counter-attacks". "We are not playing attacking football," noted Masinga. His former Bafana strike partner Mark Williams expressed his desire to start a strikers academy some years ago, but he wasn't available to give feedback on whether he had made any headway.
