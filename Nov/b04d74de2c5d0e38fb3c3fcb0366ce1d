Thousands of people who have HIV/Aids will suffer due to more nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) closing down. Chairwoman of the SA National Aids Council Mmapaseka Letsike said: "We experienced junk status rating and, ever since, we face a financial crisis as NGOs. "It is the 30-million people who live in poverty who will suffer the most." Mluleki Zazini, the national director of the National Association of People With Aids, said seven of their nine offices have been shut down. "Our Mpumalanga and Gauteng offices survive on their contracts with provincial departments of health," Zazini, who is HIV-positive, said at an event in Sandton, Johannesburg, yesterday. He also disclosed that there were people on treatment who often went to bed hungry. "We had processes that made sure people had food. Our farm in De Deur, Vaal, has been shut down. How can we expect people to continue with their treatment under those conditions?" Sello Mokhaliphi, the secretary of NGO Positive Action Campaign, said that he last received his salary four years ago. The 38-year-old who has been living with HIV for 21 years said he went without food for two days last week. Media personality Victor Kgomoeswana has challenged South Africans to donate, saying: "Most people throw leftover food into their dustbins. "If you can afford to do that you can afford to donate R5." Â Sello Maake ka Ncube and Criselda Dudumashe also attended the event.
