Pastor Paseka "Mboro" Motsoeneng has described his "Bedroom Sunday" service at the weekend, where he prayed for sex-starved couples and visited their homes to witness the impact his prayers had on their sex lives, a resounding success. Mboro decided to hold a special service at his church, the Incredible Happenings, on Sunday after Soweto TV canned an episode of his attempt to show video footage of a couple he filmed with their hands in their private parts. After that Mboro decided that he needed to help more couples who were facing sexual challenges. Yesterday, Mboro said the service was such a success he plans to hold more services this weekend. "Yesterday's [Sunday's] service was amazing, it was a celebration of bedroom testimonies and more healings," he said. Mboro said that two couples who were having problems with being intimate testified at the service about the changes they had experienced. "I prayed for a certain couple on Saturday preparing for Sunday's service, because the wife no longer had sexual feelings for her husband. They testified about changes in their marriage since I have been praying for them." He said the husband testified that his wife was now energetic in bed, while the wife said that if it wasn't for Mboro she would have divorced him. Mboro said he also prayed for a couple who did not have sex for more than a year because the man had erectile problems. "For the first time after a long time, the husband got an erection and they shared a bed together and made love." The pastor said because of the positive response he had received from people, he'd decided to extend the service to this Friday and Sunday. "I'm getting floods of calls and numbers of people who are coming ..." Mboro said.
