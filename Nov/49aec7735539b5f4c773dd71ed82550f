Bidvest Wits captain Thulani Hlatshwayo has a strong feeling that the return of his defensive partner, Buhle Mkhwanazi, will be a catalyst for the club's slump. Mkhwanazi has played four matches this season across all competitions after returning from a knee ligament injury he sustained towards the end of last term, which forced him to undergo surgery in May. Hlatshwayo sees the return of his defensive partner as a major boost for the defending champions, who are bottom of the log on nine points after 11 games. Wits, to their credit, have a chance to win silverware this weekend when they take on Bloemfontein Celtic in the Telkom Knockout final on Saturday (Princess Magogo Stadium, 6pm). "Buhle is back. Having him back is a massive boost. We have done well together [as centre-back pairing]. We started our partnership three years ago. I have played with Bongani Khumalo, Slavko Damjanovic and Phumlani Ntshangase, those were temporary partnerships," said Hlatshwayo. " "Buhle and I have played together for a while and I am happy he is back. We have different qualities. He has attributes I do not have and the same applies to me as well." Going into their encounter with Celtic on Saturday, Hlatshwayo feels Phunya Sele Sele are favourites because of their impressive form of late. "Some will say we are favourites but we are bottom on the log. I think Celtic are favourives because of their current form. We knew that this season teams were going to come for us." The Bafana Bafana captain is also positive that they can still turn things around in the league, adding that they do not even think about relegation. "We do not think about relegation. We do not want to experience that. We are upbeat that we will defend our league title. We just have to work hard each and every day to make sure that we get back to our best." Hlatshwayo was speaking yesterday at the launch of the Discovery Walter Sisulu Soccer Challenge, which kicks off on Friday until December 16.
