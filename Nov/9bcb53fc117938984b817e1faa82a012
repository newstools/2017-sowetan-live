China said on Wednesday that Zimbabwe military chief General Constantino Chiwenga’s visit to China last week was a normal military visit, after the southern African nation’s military said it had seized power. China is closely watching the situation in Zimbabwe and hopes that relevant parties can properly handle their internal affairs, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing.
