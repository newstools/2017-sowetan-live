Security guards protecting MECs in North West have no firearms and others are without permits for the guns they are using on duty.This was revealed by a group of security guards working for Tshireletso Professional Services.Tshireletso provides security services at the homes of all MECs in the provincial government, as well as top ANC officials.On Tuesday a guard was working without a firearm at a house that used to belong to former social development MEC Kgakgamatso Nkewu.A guard who did not want to be named said they were promised firearms after going through a criminal record screening process three weeks ago."I do not have a gun. I only use a baton," he said.He said police officers appointed to patrol at the same houses knew they did not have permits and guns.Each house of an MEC has three security guards who rotate daily. Another security guard said he had been working three days without a firearm permit."I think the supervisors are busy; we'll get the permits when they visit our sites," he said.The guards said it was risky for them to work without firearm permits."We do not have gun permits and no one wants to tell us why. Our lives will be in danger if something happens and we are forced to act," he said.However, company owner Solly Mothupi denied his company' s permits had expired.He said he had applied for 30-day permits."As far as I know all the 10 guns have 30-day permits," he said.Mothupi confirmed that security guards at three MEC houses were working without firearms.He said on December 24 he was issued with 10 firearms, and that he was unable to secure a further three permits as the three guards had criminal records.Mothupi was awarded the security tender that started on December 1 last year. Asked why he was allowing guards with criminal records to work, Mothupi said he did not want to be seen as a person who fires people.He said he inherited all 33 employees from the previous company that was awarded the same tender. He still needed to verify if they were competent."I cannot fire them. I told the department about the other three and I am waiting to hear from them on what to do with those three."But Sowetan has seen a permit that expired on December 31 2016. Guards also confirmed that they did not sign any new permits.The department of public works, which awarded Tshireletso the contract, said they knew about the problem and that the company owner had promised it would be fixed soon.Provincial public works head of department Pakiso Mothupi said he was aware that some staff members from Tshireletso did not have guns and gun permits."Two of those staff members have criminal records, with one charged with fraud so it was difficult for the company owner to give them firearms," he said.tshehleb@sowetan.co.za
