Johanna Konta said playing Serena Williams was a highlight of her life and she learned a lot from being on the other side of the net to the tennis great. The Briton had been on a nine-match win streak and in impeccable form heading into her Australian Open quarter-final with Williams on Wednesday, making her a genuine title contender.But, like so many others before her, found getting past the 35-year-old American is no easy task with the 22-time Grand Slam champion winning 6-2, 6-3. I think it was probably one of the best experiences of my life, Konta. I think there s so many things I can learn from that, so many things I can look to improve on, also acknowledge some things that I did well.
