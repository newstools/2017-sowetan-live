Police watchdog investigators are zeroing in on the national police commissioner and a fleet of luxury cars registered in his name.The cars which are said to include a Land Rover Discovery a Ranger Rover Sport a Toyota Hilux bakkie and a VW Amarok bakkie have all drawn the very keen interest of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid).A source close to the investigation told Timeslive that the lifestyle audit on Phahlane comes amid suspicions that he has received kickbacks from police service providers.The interest follows a raid by directorate investigators on Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane s multimillion-rand Pretoria home last week.In that raid investigators were searching for an R80 000 sound system.Phahlane who gave a warning statement to investigators last week has insisted that he bought and paid for the sound system himself.Investigators however believe that he received it as a kickback for the approval of a tender while he headed up the police forensic science laboratory.That tender saw a certain chemical manufacturer being approved to provide chemicals for the laboratory.Directorate spokesman Moses Dlamini when asked whether their investigators were looking into Phahlane s vehicles and how they were financed declined to comment. Our investigations are still on-going. National police spokesman Brigadier Sally de Beer said the allegations which were unlawfully leaked to the media were factually inaccurate and seem to be an attempt to defame and humiliate Phahlane.She said court proceedings would soon take place where all would be revealed. As in the instance where it was widely and inaccurately reported that Phahlane had received a sound system as a corrupt gift the fact was that he had paid for it himself these leaked allegations relating to vehicles are also misleading and false. A source said that the interest in Phahlane was driven by how on his salary he could afford the four vehicles registered in his name. There is a lot of interest in a number of his very expensive assets particularly given that he has been able to pay them off so quickly. TMG Digital/The Times
