Ghana coach Avram Grant has admitted captain Asamoah Gyan is a doubt for the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations after he came off injured against Egypt on Wednesday. It s not looking so good but Gyan is a very strong boy, said Grant when asked about the extent of the problem. We will need to wait and see. We will have a scan and then we will know better. Gyan was making his 99th international appearance and was looking to score his 50th goal for his country, but he went down with a groin injury towards the end of the first half and eventually came off. Jordan Ayew replaced him as Ghana lost the Group D game in Port-Gentil 1-0.Gyan described himself as a victim of a dreadful playing surface that has already come in for widespread criticism.He added: I felt a stretch in my adductor, so I don t know the extent of the injury. I m in pain right now. Tomorrow (Thursday) I will see the doctor. We will go for the MRI and then we can decide the extent of the injury. The Black Stars, runners-up in 2015, will face DR Congo in the quarter-finals in Oyem on Sunday.
