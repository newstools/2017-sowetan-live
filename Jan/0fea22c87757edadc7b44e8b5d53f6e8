Proficient boxer and arguably the country's most followed pugilist, Xolisani "Nomeva" Ndongeni, believes that he should walk away with the sought-after SA boxer of the year award.The award ceremony will be staged jointly by Boxing SA (BSA), the Department of Sport and the SABC at Inkosi Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban on January 28.The candidates in BSA's 17 categories were chosen by the public through the boxing body's nomination form.Ndongeni was nominated alongside IBO mini flyweight holder Simphiwe "Chain Reaction" Khonco and IBF International bantamweight titlist Zolani "Last Born" Tete.Ndongeni is the assertive former IBO lightweight undefeated titlist from Mount Frere in the Eastern Cape. Ndongeni and Khonco, from Ngangelizwe in Mthatha, are trained in Johannesburg by Colin "Nomakanjani" Nathan, while Tete is under the guidance of trainers Loyiso Mtya and Zolile Tete back home in Mdantsane.There is no fighter who stands head and shoulders above the rest in 2016's accomplishments so as to easily walk away with the award except for Azinga "Golden Boy" Fuzile.The four-fight novice upset the bookies when he easily dethroned vastly experienced international campaigner Mabhuti "Macman" Sinyabi as the SA featherweight champion in September.But Fuzile, who is trained by Mzamo "Chief" Njekanye in Duncan Village, was nominated for the prospect of the year award.Ndongeni said: "I have managed to remain undefeated after 22 fights. I also fought and defeated big names including Mzonke Fana [former two times IBF junior lightweight champion] and former ABU and SA lightweight champion Jasper Seroka. I went to the USA and came back with a clean win. I am one of the best in the country right now."Khonco won the IBO strap against Siyabonga Siyo, while Tete captured the IBF International belt against Victor Ruizn in the UK.Ndongeni, a former rugby player, was uncovered by Njekanye. They parted ways in 2015 after 17 wins.Nathan guided the boxer to victories for the WBA Pan African and IBO straps against Fana and Seroka, respectively, and has been in charge of Ndongeni's last five bouts.Njekanye, Nathan and Keith Rass are the three nominees for the trainer's award.
