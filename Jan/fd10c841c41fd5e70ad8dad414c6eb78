Andile Jali made his first start for Belgian league side KV Oostende in three months at the weekend and won rave reviews not only for his performance but also for his application in training.Jali made no secret of his desire to leave the club in the last transfer window and spent much of the first half of the season on the fringes of the team in part due to injury.He appeared to be frozen out by the technical team but since the winter break has cleared the air with coach Yves Vanderhaeghe.The Bafana Bafana midfielder has taken an opportunity provided by club skipper and Cameroon international S bastien Siani being away at the African Nations Cup finals in Gabon.His stand-out performance in the 1-0 win over Waasland-Beveren at the weekend should ensure a run in the side at least until Siani who plays in the same defensive midfield position returns which could be as many as four games away."It was an eternity ago [since he last played] and I had to get used to the rhythm " Jali told reporters adding he did not want to talk about what had happened in the past."I must admit that I was absolutely shattered after the final whistle."I want to speak with my feet in the coming weeks."Jali will be back in action on Tuesday night when Oostende host Charleroi in a league game before another clash with Sint Tuiden on Saturday and then the second leg of the Belgian Cup semifinal next Tuesday against Genk.It will be a punishing schedule for the Bafana midfielder and he might not feature in all.Vanderhaeghe has been full of praise for the midfielder and says he deserves the opportunity to play."He has deserved this opportunity " Vanderhaeghe said."My team was looking for a way to play better football."Andile is one of the reasons why we are playing better again."Oostende were held to a 1-1 draw by Genk in the home leg of their Belgian Cup semifinal a week ago as they seek a first-ever major trophy in the 113-year history of the competition. - TMG Digital
