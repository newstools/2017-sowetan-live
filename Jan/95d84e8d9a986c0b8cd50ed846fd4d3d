History will be in the SA boxing awards on January 28 when a knockout artist gets recognised in Boxing SA's 2016 ceremony at Durban's International Conference Centre Hall.The country's previous knockout masters such as Simon Skosana (trip hammer right hander), Jan Bergman (left hook specialist), Dingaan Thobela (uppercut specialist), Phillip Ndou (debilitating right hand) and Mabhuti Sinyabi (looping right hooker) were never recognised for their brilliance.BSA has included the Knockout Award in a list of 17 categories. That is purely because knockout artists are licensees whose execution of that killer punch adds to the excitement in boxing.It does not matter how strong, big or well built a boxer is, if they get hit directly on the jaw, they lose control over their body and drop to the ground.A punch to the jaw causes the head to suddenly spin.Points of the jaw that are most vulnerable are the sides of the chin and where the jaw is attached to the skull.So it requires skill to land a punch accurately on that spot.Three candidates are Kevin "KO Kid" Lerena, Zolani "Last Born" Tete and Lerato Dlamini.Lerena dropped Johnny "The Hurricane" Muller in the 10th round of their clash at Emperors Palace while Dlamini poleaxed Ephraim "Undertaker" Chauke in the second in the Free State.Tete's right uppercut dropped Paul Butler in the eighth round of their IBF junior bantamweight belt in the UK.But that stunning knockdown cannot win Tete the Oscar because it happened on March 6 2015.That is outside the stipulated time frame of the year in review for the awards, which is October 1 2015 to September 26 2016.Other deserving candidates are the fourth round knockout win of France "Fighting Time" Ramabolu against George Mdluli in the Free State, and the first round demolition of Leonilo Miranda by Malcolm "The Stone" Klassen in Limpopo.
