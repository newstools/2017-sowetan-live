The preparations are going very well and logistics all on track for the African National Congress (ANC) 105th birthday bash at the weekend the party s treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize said on Friday morning.In a series of tweets based on an interview with @ANN7tv Mkhize was quoted as saying that Unity in Action one of the key themes of the celebration is about a call for ANC to build unity in light of tensions existing .He said the party needed to tackle the issue of factionalism that is facing our organisation and even weighed in on who would replace President Jacob Zuma and the leadership of the ANC saying members must look at (the) quality of candidates. Debate is open on principles only .Mkhize took aim at negative social media campaigns that had sprung up this week most notably Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema s tweet that people who attended the celebrations were traitors and the #DontFillUpOrlando hashtag. We will not be deterred by detractors said Mkhize. They will always be there. The campaigns emanate from non-ANC members and the party was open to issues raised and have done serious introspection .
