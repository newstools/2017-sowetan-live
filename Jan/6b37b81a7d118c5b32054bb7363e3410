Black Leopards boss David Thidiela will be hauled over the coals by the SA Football Association (Safa) over his criticism of referees.Thidiela told Metro FM radio on December 19 that "referees are doing as they wish" in the National First Division.This was despite the fact that his team had beaten Royal Eagles 2-1 in Thohoyandou two days earlier in a match that was officiated by Cape Town referee, Anwar Alexander.Safa's legal officer Tebogo Motlanthe said yesterday Thidiela would appear before a disciplinary committee at Safa House tomorrow at 10am."David Thidiela has been charged with bringing the association into disrepute, breaching the media policy and discrimination because he also said discriminatory words against the referee [Alexander]," said Motlanthe.Thidiela also confirmed the charges, but refrained from commenting further."I'm not going to comment, because I've been advised by my lawyers not to do so," he said.Thidiela was critical of referee Alexander during his radio interview, but claimed that this is widespread in the division."I saw miracles [when Leopards played Eagles], but God being God I came out the winner," he said.Thidiela claims that he "followed the right procedure" and wrote to the PSL to lay a complaint against Alexander. Safa, which is in charge of referees, insisted that running to the media was no solution."We don't want to be seen like we are silencing people. You don't want to create an impression that if you speak about the shenanigans [you will be charged] and once you rush to charge people, you also get the corruptors who are happy to say he has been charged," Motlanthe said."Don't go to the media, but rather report it [to Safa] and if you don't get a follow-up from me, then escalate the matter to the CEO [Dennis Mumble]."Football agent and club owner Tim Sukazi is also in Safa's firing line.Sukazi, who owns TS Galaxy who campaign in the ABC Motsepe League in Mpumalanga, was also heard recently asking questions about referees in the lower league."I think the officials at Safa have to come out and work on it. I've brought it to their attention, so much so that I've given them the details. A club like Acornbush [United] in 14 or 15 games they were given about 14 penalties," Sukazi told SABC.Motlanthe said he too could be charged.
