Wayde van Niekerk started out as "Wayde Dreamer" and the sprinter is now living his dream as the Olympic champion.There is a new dreamer in town.Mpho Gift Radebe, from Bophelong, west of Vanderbijlpark, goes around carrying a document emblazoned with the words "Be part of 2020 Olympics Games".The eight-pager - complete with Radebe's sport CV, merit certificates and ID copy - is actually a ready-made proposal.Sowetan followed him over two days from his RDP house to the local tennis courts, which are a walk away.Raised by a single mother who died when Radebe was only 14, the rising ace has been living alone since, surviving on the government social grant and rent income from a tenant who lives in the shack outside.Radebe said tennis was his salvation and refuge from the hardship that he faced. Against all odds he completed his matric.Since finishing school he has had part-time jobs but often got fired because of his commitment to tennis. That didn't stop him from hustling."I have fought hard not to be influenced by my peers to join gangs and roam the streets at night. I will continue to fight to turn my life around and succeed in tennis," he vowed.Glossy pictures of Rafael Nadal, the Spanish superstar, somehow give life to Radebe's sparsely furnished house, which doesn't even have a TV set for him to watch his heroes in action.Despite his evident adoration of Nadal, Radebe's favourite player is world number one Andy Murray, but he said he never came across a perfect picture of the British star hence he opted for the Spaniard.The youngster is well aware that only hard work can catapult him to the leagues of Nadal and Murray - and ultimately the Olympics."I can't afford tennis equipment and rely on my coach to pass on his old rackets and balls to me."Our tennis courts are clay and my tennis shoes do not last longer than three months," said Radebe, sporting battered takkies, a worn out racket and tennis balls.It has been a long journey for the lad whose name Gift is actually a direct translation of Mpho.He realised his special gift at school when he was 10.He chose tennis over soccer.Today he plays under the Vaal Tennis Club where he has won a few tournaments.These days Radebe is a regular in local tournaments but he can't afford to travel beyond his township to test himself against the best in the country and get a ranking.Notwithstanding his circumstances, the rising ace said he was encouraged by community members who frequently throw words of encouragement on his routine walk to the Bophelong sports centre to practise with friends."Players from townships are not supported enough and they end up being involved in gangs and substance abuse," he said.
