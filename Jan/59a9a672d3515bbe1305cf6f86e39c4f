Norma Plummer, coach of South Africa's netball side the Spar Proteas, has named a strong team for what's sure to be an enthralling SANZEA quad series in Durban at the end of this month.The experienced and reliable Bongi Msomi will captain the team during the series at the Durban International Convention Centre, which will play host to the world's powerhouses Australia, New Zealand and England.This will be the third leg of the quad series, after the first two legs were played in New Zealand and Australia in August and September respectively last year.The hosts will take on England in their opening match on January 28 (5pm), while Australia, who are ranked number one in the world, will take on New Zealand on the same day (3pm). Three days later, the Proteas will take on Australia (7pm).The quad series will then move to England next month where the Proteas are due to take on New Zealand on February 5.Plummer, meanwhile, will be mentoring former Proteas player Dumisani Chauke, who will form part of the coaching team during the series. Chauke has been in charge of the national under-21 side and the chance to sit with the senior coaching team is probably a good sign for the future.The Proteas:Lenize Potgieter, Renske Stoltz, Vanes Marie Du Toit, Lindie Lombard, Bongi Msomi (Captain), Izette Lubbe, Erin Burger, Precious Mthembu, Karla Mostert, Phumza Maweni, Zanele Vimbela and Juline Rossouw
