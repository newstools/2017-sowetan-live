Contrary to reports that Kaizer Chiefs would lose Lorenzo Gordinho for free, the club said yesterday the defender had in fact renewed his contract.The 22-year-old is back home after a one-week trial at Danish side Aalborg BK, and there were suggestions that the Scandinavians could land Gordinho as a free agent amid claims his contract with Chiefs would automatically end in June.While he was a bit reluctant, Amakhosi football manager Bobby Motaung revealed to Sowetan yesterday that the player had extended his stay, which means Chiefs would be within their rights to place a pricetage on the player in any team came knocking with an offer for his services."Gordinho has extended his contract, but we haven't made the announcement. I can't give you all the details," said Motaung, adding: "I have just returned to the office [from holiday]." Motaung refused to comment any further, and the player's agent Mike Makaab could not be reached to confirm details of the new deal.Chiefs, however, have previously stated that they would not stand in Gordinho's way if Aalborg want to sign him following his assessment at the European club.Meanwhile, Motaung also set the record straight regarding Mamelodi Sundowns player Anthony Laffor.The Liberian is in the last six months of his contract with the Brazilians, and there is growing speculation that he has signed a pre-contract with Chiefs.Motaung, however, made it clear yesterday that this is just mere speculation."There is no such thing. We haven't spoken about Laffor and we haven't even had a discussion about Laffor," insisted Motaung, who added Chiefs would have proper updates soon regarding player movements at the club once he had consulted with the technical team.However, striker Siphelele Mthembu is expected to join Bloemfontein Celtic on loan for the rest of the season.Mthembu, who has not played an official match for the first team this season, is already training with Celtic.Other changes to expect at Chiefs are the possible signings of Italian striker Gustavo Paez, 26, who has apparently impressed while on trial, and Malawian defender Miracle Gabeya, 20.The other players who have been on trial at Chiefs are Brazilian defender Pedro DeAmorim and Olivier Toure, who is from Ivory Coast.Amakhosi are in camp in Potchefstroom.
