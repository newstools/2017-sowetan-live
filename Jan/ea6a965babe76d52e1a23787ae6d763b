Spar Proteas captain Bongi Msomi has made it clear that they won't put themselves under pressure to play "catch up", when they take part in the SANZEA netball quad series here.Netball SA will be hosting the quad series for the first time at the ICC Conventional Centre, with top three ranked sides Australia, New Zealand and England all in Durban to take part in the third leg of the series.The Proteas, who go into the series as the lowest-ranked side at fifth, have an opportunity to close the gap between themselves and the three other sides in the competition, but Msomi and her teammates are more concerned about improving and being consistent.SA will take on England tomorrow (5pm), while the Australian Diamonds take on the New Zealand Silver Ferns (3pm)."Every player who comes to the Proteas comes to do their best. It will be nice to play against the best in the world, not to try catch up, but to improve our own game," said Msomi yesterday."We have been doing that so well, so it's a matter of being consistent. We are looking forward to gelling well as a team. We will see if we are improving or going backwards, but I believe we are improving."She added: "It's always crucial to perform. We have been working so hard."England captain Ama Agbeze has seen how the Proteas have improved as a team and knows they'll have a tough time on the court tomorrow."South Africa has developed over the years. When we met at the quad series in Australia, they led 8-0 in the first quarter and we do not want that to happen again."People have to take South Africa seriously," she said.After playing England, the Proteas will face Australia on Tuesday.
