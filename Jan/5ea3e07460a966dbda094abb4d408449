Olwethu Zikhali of Phoenix Durban must be the only pupil in the country who started the new school year by arriving at school in a red Ferrari ushered in by a marching band and a troupe of cheerleaders on Tuesday.The Greenbury Primary School grade 7 learner was the winner of Freedom Stationery s First Fab Day Back to School competition.The overwhelmed Zikhali 12 waved at the crowds of applauding classmates as he got out of the revving car. I m going to have the best year he said adding that he always dreamed about travelling in a fancy car. I have seen Ferraris on the road but I didn t think I would ever go to school in one. The prize which included his 2017 academic fees a new school uniform a Marlin stationery hamper and a Marlin bag of goodies for each of his classmates also entailed being chauffeur-driven to school in a Ferrari. Because Zikhali lives only a kilometre away from his school he was driven around his area three times before arriving at the school gates.He says he was surprised when he won but that he had prayed a lot for the win.Described by principle Collin Ponsamy as a quiet and unassuming learner Zikhali lives with his mother Phumzile Masuko who said that the win had come as something of a financial relief for her. I struggled throughout 2016 as a single parent to take good care of him and his brother who is at university. I even sold my car to make things work. This is a blessing. Ponsamy added that the win had created publicity that was good for the school. We will use the increased interest as a platform to access donors he said We service some very poor communities but we strive for excellence. Greenbury Primary School has won a number of accolades including being the top health-promoting school in eThekwini.This is the third year that Freedom Stationery has run its Back to School competition. The company hopes to take it national next year. TMG Digital/The Times
