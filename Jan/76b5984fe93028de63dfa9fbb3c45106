South Africa could wrap up the three-match T20 series against Sri Lanka with a game to spare if they win at Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on Sunday afternoon.The Proteas beat Sri Lanka by 19 runs in the rain-affected first match in Centurion on Friday and victory on Sunday would see them travel to the Cape Town on Wednesday hoping for complete a whitewash.At the Wanderers focus will firmly be on young fast bowler Lungi Ngidi who was named man of the match on his debut in Centurion for his economic return of 2/12.Ngidi who was tasked with the huge responsibility of taking the new ball after Sri Lanka won the toss and inserted South Africa in the rain affected match that was reduced to ten overs impressed with his tight lengths lines and pace. In the past I have played in a few finals which exposed me to high pressure situations and that was my slight advantage " Ngidi said after the match."Opening the bowling for your country is not a joke but a serious matter. So I tried to focus on the things that worked for me and stayed in the moment."In those situations there is nothing much you can do other than deliver the ball one at a time and see what happens. It is one of the best feelings and I am very happy. The first over I just wanted to get my line and length right I knew opening the bowling was a crucial stage of the match and it was important that we get off to a good start. - TMG Digital
