Proteas limited overs spinner Imran Tahir said he would love to have the selectorial headache of not knowing when to add AB de Villiers to the ODI squad. On Sunday De Villiers scored a List A hundred for Northerns against Easterns in Benoni announcing a return to the game after six months out with an elbow injury.Cricket South Africa confirmed he will be available for the third T20 in Cape Town on Wednesday. If I was the captain of an international team knowing I was going to have AB back in the team I'd probably have trouble sleeping because of excitement " Tahir said."That's how much of a big deal it is to have him back in the team."That's how much we want him back in the team and I heard he batted well and is ready to play again. We're very excited and we have every reason to be because he's the best in the business if not one of the best in the world. While Sunday's second T20 did not go according to plan for the Proteas Tahir was a bright spark and took advantage of the sub-continental conditions at the Wanderers.It was the kind of pitch Tahir would roll up and keep in his pocket especially in South Africa where there's almost nothing on offer for the spinners except in Port Elizabeth and East London to an extent.The three wicket defeat is not something that concerned Tahir especially with the young nature of the team.He said the performances of young players like Lungi Ngidi far outweighed the negative batting display that saw the hosts skittled out for 113 in 19.4 overs.Ngidi's tenacity and Tahir's tenacity made Sri Lanka's chase a tough one.Angelo Mathews's ability to remain calm in pressure situations and his batting with one leg allowed the visitors to win their first match of the tour and only their fifth T20 match in 19 games. We won the first game with the same team and even though we didn't win this one it was a very good game."We looked like we wanted to win and it's the brand of cricket that we South African's like to play."That was the case in this game and we didn't lose by a big margin and I'm confident this side will do well in the next game. Funny that I enjoyed bowling here because it's the first time I've bowled at the Wanderers and went for less than 20 runs in my spell."It was a very new wicket and it surprised everyone."The guys bowled well and all we needed was one partnership but we didn't get that. - TMG Digital
