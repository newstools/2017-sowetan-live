After a break of almost two months the Sunfoil Series returns to action on Thursday morning.The Cobras host the Lions in Oudtshoorn the Titans travel to the Knights in Bloemfontein and the Dolphins will be at home to the Warriors in Durban.The campaign paused in November with the Cobras at the foot of the table and the Cape side has since parted ways with former coach Paul Adams.Adams was redeployed to the development structures and was replaced by former Proteas batsman Ashwell Prince.The Cobras also has a new captain in the form of Dane Piedt .Piedt will lead the side in an interim capacity and together with Prince they will be looking to get their wrecked campaign of no win after five matches back on track. We have been sub-standard so far this season " Prince said."What we need is that players perform up to the class they have displayed throughout their careers and they keys for us are simply improved performances."Prince who was assistant to Adams earlier in the term has been boosted by the availability of Proteas all-rounder Wayne Parnell who was released from the national team camp this week to link up with his franchise team-mates.Visiting coach Geoffrey Toyana said he is expecting a difficult start to the year against a Cobras side where players will be looking to impress the new coach. We have played well against the Cobras this season but they are a quality side if you look at the names in their squad."They have also made some big changes to their set-up and you have Ashwell Prince as coach said Toyana.While Prince has welcomed back Parnell to the squad Toyana is counting his losses as influential spinner Eddie Leie is doubt due to injury.Elsewhere log-leaders and recently crowned T20 Challenge champions Titans will be hoping to maintain their place at the top of the pile against second-placed Knights in the top of the table clash at the Mangaung Oval.Knights coach Nicky Boje has been boosted by the availability of captain Theunis de Bruyn after he was released from the Proteas in Cape Town while new signing Keegan Petersen has also been included in the squad.For Titans coach Mark Boucher he is expected to have Proteas all-rounder Chris Morris back after a lengthy injury lay-off and spinner Tabraiz Shamsi.In Durban Dolphins coach Grant Morgan welcomes back Andile Phehlukwayo Daryn Smit and Brandon Scullard who returns from respective injuries but will miss Daryn Dupavillon who has not responded to treatment.For the visiting Warriors coach Malibongwe Maketa said he was desperate for his side to build on their efforts from 2016. We were quite pleased with how the first half went even though we fully understand that a lot of work lies ahead."What happened last year is done and dusted we don t have any trophies to show for our efforts and that s what we want to continue striving to achieve. - TMG Digital
