The statement quoted Stars general manager Rantsi Mokoena as saying: The mutual termination of the head coach s employment contract was based on the fact that the coach and the management of the team did not share the same vision with regard to the approach for the remainder of the season and the future and as a result both parties have decided to amicably terminate the relationship. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the head coach for his hard work throughout his employment with the club and we wish him all the best for the future. Furthermore the club would like to announce the appointment of Serame Letsoaka as the new head coach for the remainder of the season whom we believe will guide our club to great success.
