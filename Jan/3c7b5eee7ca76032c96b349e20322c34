Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is not yet on the African National Congress list for Parliament party secretary general Gwede Mantashe said on Monday.Mantashe said half of the list of people nominated for Parliament came from provinces while the other half were nominated at a national level. This means that eight of the nine provinces will have a list of parliamentarians who are going to the National Assembly on the province-to-national list. That constitutes the list of the ANC registered with the IEC. You cannot amend that list before you finish 12 months. Mantashe said if the list is amended in a particular month it cannot be changed for the next 12 months. If for example a particular province which is the home of Brian Molefe want to include him there. There are only two opportunities for him to get into the list first before he goes to Parliament because he is not in the Parliament list yet There is no Brian in the Parliament yet. But if his province want to amend it must wait for the anniversary of its national amendments. At that point it can reprioritise its list. If it prioritises Brian then he will be the first to replace whoever gets out of Parliament when there is a vacancy. Or if its list is depleted then you can replenish the depleted list with new names. That is another opportunity for Brian to be in that list. If in the province-to-national he gets in that list he will be in line to go to Parliament and that point has not arrived yet Mantashe said.He was addressing journalists following the ANC national executive committee lekgotla.His response comes after the Sunday Times reported that the ANC in North West wants to put Molefe on its parliamentary list so that he would ultimately become the new finance minister in a foreseen cabinet reshuffle.
