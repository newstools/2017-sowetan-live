An ANC member who allegedly impersonated North West premier Supra Mahumapelo yesterday appeared in court for fraud.Thato Hangari, 25, from Kuruman in Northern Cape was arrested on December 20 for defrauding Roger Ditse, the head of security at the North West legislature, of R3500.Initially it was reported in the media that he was charged with impersonation, conspiracy, intimidation and fraud, but yesterday prosecutor Neo Sedumedi revealed that he was only facing one count of fraud.According to the charge sheet, Hangari robbed Ditse by telling him he needed R3500 for food and petrol. He allegedly said he was instructed by Mahumapelo to ask for the money from Ditse.Sedumedi said the state was planning to add more charges after investigations were completed.Hangari's lawyer Titswa Modise pleaded with the court to reduce his client's bail amount to R500. This was after the state had requested that he be given a R2000 bail on condition that he report to the local police station once a week and hand over his passport.Modise said his client did not have previous convictions and that the state must not impose harsh conditions on his bail.However, magistrate Ditiro Goliath granted him a R1000 bail. The case was postponed to March 29.Last month, Mahumapelo's office warned the public about an imposter who goes around phoning unsuspecting members of the public, pretending to be him.According to the statement, Hangari phoned Deputy Minister of Cooperative Governance Andries Nel, Ditse, and Deputy Minister of Labour Inkosi Patekile Holomisa.Mahumapelo's spokesman Brian Setswambung said the alleged trickster has requested money from several people in Gauteng, North West, Western Cape and Eastern Cape.Setswambung said in one of the incidents, the imposter contacted an MP in Western Cape, requesting financial assistance for an alleged student, who was purportedly stranded in Cape Town.
