Kevin "KO Kid" Lerena still sports movie-star looks despite having fought 97 rounds in a career which dates back to 2011.The 24-year-old left-hander - who holds the SA and WBA Pan African cruiserweight belts - says he makes sure he protects himself at all times, as is the norm in the fistic sport.Lerena - who has eight knockouts in 16 wins against a loss - was speaking to Sowetan after his open day workout yesterday for his international 10-rounder against Namibian Vikapita "The Beast Master" Meroro at Emperors Palace on February 4."I have got a great defence," said the supremely built boxer who revenged his points loss to Johnny "The Hurricane" Muller with a 10th-round knockout against the same foe."I always work hard on my defence but I also intend to take my offence to new levels."Lerena does not want to entertain the idea that Meroro - a former WBO Africa holder from Windhoek - could be ring rusty as he has not fought competitively since May 2015.That was when the 32-year-old boxer - who has flattened 14 of his 28 victims against five losses, was knocked out in the sixth round by Dmitry Kudryashov of Russia."He is a very experienced opponent and we take no opponents lightly," said Lerena whose non-title bout against Meroro will form part of Golden Gloves "Thunder and Lightning" bill."I am going to win because I am too hungry and I work hard. I have never been outworked. My dedication take me through my fights. I also have skills to back it."The tournament will feature a vacant IBO junior flyweight championship between Hekkie "Hexecutioner" Budler and Joey Canoy from the Philippines.Budler and his stable mate Ryno "The Lion" Liebenberg were also part of the public workout.Liebenberg will welcome German Enrico Koeling in a rematch. Koeling outpointed the local fighter in their first fight in Germany in October. But the verdict was debatable.
