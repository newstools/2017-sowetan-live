Fifa's ruling council yesterday unanimously approved an expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams in 2026, in a major coup for the body's president Gianni Infantino.In a bid to widen the game's global appeal and enrich its coffers, the Fifa panel endorsed a format with 16 groups of three nations, a tweet from Fifa's official account said.The move represents the first major change to the World Cup since the tournament was boosted from 24 to 32 teams for the 1998 tournament in France.Critics strongly opposed the move and it was branded a "money grab and power grab" by New Fifa Now, a group campaigning for reform of the scandal-tainted Fifa.Football's powerful European Club Association (ECA) reiterated its opposition, describing the 32-team model as "the perfect formula"."We understand that this decision has been taken based on political reasons rather than sporting ones and under considerable political pressure, something ECA believes is regrettable," the body said in a statement.Despite the opposition, Infantino had in recent weeks voiced confidence that his flagship project would be approved, noting it would improve Fifa's bank account. Africa and Asia could be the big winners with a rise in their number of places - currently at five for Africa and between four and five for Asia.The format envisages 80 matches - 16 more than the current set up - but crucially will still be played over the same 32 days. Two teams from each group will advance to a 32-nation knockout round.Bidding to host the 2026 tournament has not yet opened, but Infantino has voiced support for two countries sharing the duty.
