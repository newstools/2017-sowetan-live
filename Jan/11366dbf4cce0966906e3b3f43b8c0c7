Things might finally be looking up for South African midfielder Bongani Zungu at Portuguese club Vitoria Guimaraes after he netted his first goal for the club this week.Zungu netted in the second minute of injury-time to seal a 2-2 draw for Vitoria in their Portuguese Cup group phase clash with fellow top-flight side Pa os de Ferreira on Tuesday night.The match was also a first start for the 24-year-old former Mamelodi Sundowns star and perhaps a sign that he is finally beginning to win some favour with coach Pedro Martins.Zungu has had to bide his time on the sidelines since recovering from long-term injury and has also made a couple of appearances for the club s B side who campaign in the Portuguese second-tier.His next goal will be to make a first appearance for Vitoria in the league having just made a solitary appearance as an unused substitute for the team in that competition in November.If he can get game-time he will provide another option for the incoming Bafana Bafana coach having been something of a regular with the national side before being injured while playing for Sundowns last January which kept him sidelined for nine months.Vitoria must finish top of their Portuguese Cup group to advance to the semifinals and have four points from two games so far.But they are yet to face favourites Benfica with that clash set for next Tuesday. - TMG Digital
