Cheetahs coach Franco Smith was not concerned about the 43-7 scoreline against the Stormers in their first pre-season match in Harare on Saturday because his objectives for the match were not based on the result.The Cheetahs were outscored by seven tries to one but Smith fielded a starting team that included two players who were part of the Currie Cup final last October. The match also featured up to 10 substitutions and in essence it was a hugely experimental Cheetahs team made up of under-21 and fringe players. The score wasn t a true reflection of the performance Smith said. We gave away five turnover tries after dominating territory. We had more scrums and lineouts but we had an inexperienced team. I only used two players from the Currie Cup final because our objectives from this game were to allow game time to many players who haven t played since last June. There is no club rugby in Bloemfontein during the Currie Cup so it was important to get these players on the field in a competitive match. The main aim was to build some depth because when we reach rounds seven to 11 during Super Rugby that s when we re going to play against the New Zealand sides which might coincide when we start feeling the effects of injuries and bumps and bruises. So I have to know what I ve got in terms of depth. That was my main objective out of this game and I saw some really good play from a lot of the young guys. Most people will read a lot into the scoreboard but that was not our objective at all. The Cheetahs will have a training camp in Durban this week as they prepare to take on the Sharks in their next Super Rugby warm-up match at the weekend.
