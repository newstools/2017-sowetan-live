The family of a police officer who was shot on duty during an armed robbery was yesterday inconsolable during his memorial, saying no one would ever understand their pain.Family representative, Dr Letsatsi Moeketsi, said though they were receiving comforting messages, no one felt their pain.Moeketsi was speaking at Constable Tshepo Tladi's memorial service at the Uniting Reformed Church in Katlehong yesterday.Tladi, 35, who together with his colleagues had responded to an armed robbery call a week ago, died during an exchange of fire with the armed robbers.It was initially believed that Tladi, who had been in the force for eight years, was killed by the robbers but video footage that captured his last moments showed that he could have been killed by one of his colleagues.His death brought back bitter memories as Tladi's mother, who was also a police officer, also died on duty. She was shot and killed by her metro cop boyfriend in 2005 at Vosloorus police station following a quarrel.Moeketsi said he never thought the family would suffer the same fate again."We cannot describe the pain we are going through. Personally I did not believe he would follow his mother's tracks in the way he died."Moeketsi said Tladi's mother could have been saved."When Tshepo's mother was shot, somebody was there and did nothing, someone who could have saved the situation," he said.Moeketsi pleaded with SAPS to give them answers."SAPS, please convince us that the video clip was fabricated. If that clip is not fabricated then what are you doing here? We hope and pray that this justice we are talking about will be served."What happened, tell us what happened. We released Tshepo to serve the country. Get rid of the criminals in uniform. We are very hurt," said Moeketsi.South African Police Union chairman Richard Mboweni said Tladi's death was shameful."When I [saw] that clip, I could not sleep. You put yourself in that situation and you understand what the family is going through."Mboweni said police killings should be taken seriously."An attack on the police is an attack on the state," he said.The video that went viral angered his family and acting police commissioner Khgomotso Phahlane.The family said they were not told the truth about Tladi's murder until they saw the video.Phahlane said officers ignored basic things like calling for emergency assistance.He condemned the circulation of the video, saying it was insensitive to the family.Phalane said the video will assist in the investigations.Tladi will be buried on Saturday.
