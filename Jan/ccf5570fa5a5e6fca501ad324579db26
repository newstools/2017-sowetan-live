The African Nations Cup finals in Gabon get under way on Saturday and although Bafana Bafana will not be there there will still be much interest in how the top talent from around the continent fares.Times Media Digital picks 10 Players to Watch at the continental showpiece from the established stars through to up-and-coming talents. 1) RAMADAN SOBHI (EGYPT) A teenage forward with Stoke City in the English Premier League Sobhi has been marked as a future superstar.He made his Egypt debut two years ago as a 17-year-old and is an exciting left wing with requisite skills and pace.Egypt are returning to the Nations Cup for the first time since 2010 and expectations are they will be among the contenders come the later knockout stages. 2) ADAMA TRAORE (MALI) The Monaco forward is only 21 but already has a big reputation having been named the best player at the 2015 U-20 World Cup in New Zealand his four goals helping Mali to a bronze medal.Mali are Dark Horses for the title and should they go all the way Traore will have played a major role. 3) ERIC BAILLY (IVORY COAST) Ivory Coast have put the centre-back through some intensive rehabilitation to get him ready for the finals in Gabon such is his importance to the side.With the likes of Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba having retired from international football Bailley is next in line as the side s genuine superstar.A 30-million pound move to Manchester United from Villarreal in Spain at the start of the season thrust him into the limelight. 4) EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR (TOGO) Adebayor is the last of the Golden Generation of African strikers that also included Drogba and Samuel Eto o but is in the final throws of his career.He has not played club football for over six months having been released by English Premier League side Crystal Palace at the end of last season.Adebayor whose parents came from Nigeria has had a testy relationship with Togo retiring several times from international duty when playing in African competition did not suit his agenda.But such is his influence that Togo welcome him back every time. 5) RIYAD MAHREZ (ALGERIA) Newly-crowned African Footballer of the Year Mahrez has plenty to prove at these Nations Cup finals having seen his form dip alarmingly since helping Leicester City to a shock English Premier League win last year.The playmaker has undoubted quality but has been a virtual passenger for The Foxes this season. Perhaps the thought of a Nations Cup winner's medal will spark him back into life.6) SADIO MANE (SENEGAL) Senegal have a host of talented individuals but chief among these are forward Mane who has been a revelation for Liverpool this season.He has pace skill and great vision having been part of the national team for four years after graduating from the Diambars academy in Senegal to play at Metz in France then Red Bull Salzburg in Austria and onto England with Southampton.He was named as one of the finalists for the 2016 African Footballer of the Year award. 7) KHAMA BILLIAT (ZIMBABWE) Billiat has proven himself on the African club stage with Mamelodi Sundowns and was unlucky not to pick up the African-based Footballer of the Year prize this year.But this will be a different level and a chance to test himself against top defenders from Europe s big leagues. Can he catch the eye of the hundreds of watching European clubs?8) PIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG (GABON) Aubameyang is the undisputed kingpin of the Gabon side and for him there is always pressure to perform.But he carries even more weight on his shoulders this time as part of the home team who will be expected to make the semifinals at least and he will be the man tasked with getting them there.Aubameyang was first a French junior international before almost reluctantly throwing his lot in with Les Pantherers . 9) NICOLAS NKOULOU (CAMEROON) Nkoulou has been one of Africa s best defenders for several years now although outside of France enjoys little of the profile that predecessors like Stephen Tataw Emmanuel Kunde and Rigobert Song did.The 26-year-old from Yaounde is approaching 70 caps for his country and will likely skipper the side in Gabon too. It will be some task with the Indomitable Lions having endured so many withdrawals prior to the tournament. 10) DENIS ONYANGO (UGANDA) The reigning Africa-based Footballer of the Year has enjoyed so much success in the last 12 months but has also had a tendency to falter at vital moments.The Sundowns goalkeeper will have to be at his absolute best if Uganda are to make it into the knockout stages.It is also a chance for him to showcase his quality to a global audience after disappointing in last month s FIFA Club World Cup. - TMG Digital
