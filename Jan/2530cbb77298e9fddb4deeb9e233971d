An established and explosive middle order batsman David Miller is eyeing a higher spot on the Proteas batting lineup.Miller a veteran of 87 ODIs and 46 T20s since 2010 could be promoted to the top order in the three T20 matches against Sri Lanka set to get under way in Centurion on Friday.The Proteas have picked a significantly inexperienced side for the series against Sri Lanka after resting a number of key players and Miller believes his experience will benefit the team against wounded opposition who are still smarting from a 3-0 Test whitewash. I would like to bat higher up on the order because I happened to bat higher up for the Knights this season which was a nice responsibility " he said."I feel like I have learned a lot in the past couple of years."We are going to sit down this week and see where everyone fits in because it is a new team and if situations allow I would like to take it on. It is the same with the ODI side if I get the opportunity to bat higher I would love to take it on. Since he made his debut six years ago Miller has displayed sporadic performances of sheer brilliance with the bat and while fielding to help South Africa to crucial victories.But he has failed to produce the goods consistently. The last couple of months things have been working really well for me."Things have sort of clicked and gone my way and I have worked hard behind the scenes so that I can be at a high level."It is really pleasing to see that my hard work is paying off handsomely and I am looking forward to the next couple of weeks where I will be working with all the players and getting a little team culture in this T20 team. He has also managed to overcome injuries that plagued him in the past setbacks many believe were behind his inconsistency. I had groin and calf injuries but they were minor."I have played a few games since then and I am feeling strong and healthy again."It has been a process for the past two and half years I feel like I have grown and gained a lot in that period."It was disappointing to miss out on most of the CSA T20 Challenge matches this season after I managed to start well. - TMG Digital
