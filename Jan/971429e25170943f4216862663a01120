The Spar Proteas' incredible fight-back against England on Saturday had a lot to do with the amazing crowd at the Durban International Convention Centre.Against the odds, the Proteas fought back from 11 goals down in the second half of the SANZEA netball quad series match, to take clash into extra time where their opponents ended up winning 60-55.The spine-tingling cheers, from young and old supporters, inspired a much improved performance from the hosts. It's exactly what the Proteas will need from the crowd, in fact better if possible, when they take on number one ranked side Australia tonight (7pm)."At some point [against England], we did not even hear the whistle. It was crazy and I got goosebumps. The crowd was amazing, lifting us up and cheering us all the way. It's great to play here and have the backing of the people," said Proteas player Lindie Lombard.Precious Mthembu was also impressed with the crowd on match day and said the constant singing and cheering is the reason they came back strongly."Sometimes you feel your legs can't go on for longer, but hearing the crowd is what really pushes you. After the shots, everybody stands up and shouts for us, which is amazing. It was good to see everyone coming from all over the country," said Mthembu.Australian captain Shani Layton, who is vocal on the court and always fires up her teammates, expects an even bigger crowd to back the Proteas, but the visitors are not likely to be intimidated by it."We know the noise will be triple that. But in saying that, we have been practising being loud ourselves," said Layton.
