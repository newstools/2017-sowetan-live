The SA Football Association (Safa) won't hand stand-in coach Desiree Ellis the Banyana Banyana head coaching job on a silver platter, it seems.After finishing fourth at the African Women's Championship in Cameroon late last year, Ellis still has some convincing to do to get the coaching position on a permanent basis.Safa is yet to engage Ellis on the position that was left vacant by Vera Pauw after the 2016 Olympics in Rio.The federation is, however, giving her some time to prove herself in the position and a good performance in a friendly match against France on Sunday could go a long way in securing the dream job.The match will take place in Saint Denis, Reunion Islands (7pm, SA time)."Nothing yet. Everybody is just back at work," said Ellis in reference to the latest on the vacant post. "The friendly came, so we just jumped straight into it. All I can do is try prepare the team. It's up to the powers that be to decide what they want to do."The former Banyana captain believes a good result against the world's third-ranked team would speed up the process of being appointed full time."I think a good result and performance would do that. I can't say whether or not it's promising. [But] I am still here, so that's promising," said Ellis during the team's training in Auckland Park, Johannesburg yesterday.A big challenge for Banyana this year is that there are no major competitions to participate in, so they'll rely on friendly internationals to stay active."There's a lot of Fifa dates and we are hoping to take advantage of those days. We have not sat down to say what we want to do. Even if we don't get a game, we can have a camp to see where the players are at and to work on their conditioning," said Ellis.
