Mamelodi Sundowns have breathed a sigh of relief after winning the case against their own player Keagan Dolly.The winger had challenged Sundowns through the PSL's Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) on a matter relating to a European buyout clause in his contract, which expires in June 2019.The DRC has ruled in Sundowns' favour, stipulating Dolly's buyout clause is R25-million.Sundowns signed Dolly in August 2014 on a four-year contract that included a one-year option. One of the clauses in the contract stated that his European buyout clause would be 1.5- million (R25-million).The Tshwane side then amended the contract last year and by their own admission, made a "mistake" by changing the buyout to a mere R10.5-million.On realising the "mistake", Sundowns took the matter to the DRC, and this was challenged by Dolly and his representatives. The DRC's decision to rule in favour of Sundowns has incensed the SA Football Players Union (Safpu)."We are very disappointed with the ruling. We are not going to take this lying down. We will study the ruling and take it from there. Dolly had a strong case," said Safpu's general secretary Thulaganyo Gaoshubelwe.If Dolly files an appeal with the SA Football Association (Safa), he would have to pay an initial fee of R23 000 for the sitting and if the matter goes to arbitration, he will need a further R30 000 out of his own pocket.Dolly has already spent more than R200 000 on legal fees on this case.The union believes this was not a genuine mistake by Sundowns because the contract was overseen by two Sundowns lawyers when amended, including their legal and commercial manager Yugesh Singh.The DRC's decision could scupper Dolly's European dream.Greek side Olympiacos were willing to pay ?800000 (about R11.5-million) for his services six months ago, which alerted Sundowns to the "mistake", and French side Montpellier will be submitting an offer of ?1-million (about R14- million). But with Sundowns winning the case, Dolly's buyout is now back at R25-million and the two teams may baulk at the fee.
