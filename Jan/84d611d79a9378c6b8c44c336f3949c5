The KwaZulu-Natal education department has a 9-point plan to fix under-performing schools which was unveiled today during a meeting led by MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana. The 2016 overall pass rate for KwaZulu-Natal was 66.4% with 85 schools that achieved 100% pass rate as opposed to 66 schools in 2015. That is great improvement the department said in a statement. It is however with deep sense of embarrassment disappointment and disbelief that in 2016 the province had 30 schools that obtained between 0% and 10% pass rate. This remains a serious cause for concern and drastic measures need to be implemented immediately to move all of them to 50% and above. All principals of the schools that performed below 0-10% in the 2016 Grade 12 results were called to a meeting with Dlungwana today.The department said a number of challenges were tabled by the representatives of the affected schools which ranged from lack of discipline community factional fights that spill over to school premises post provision norms (PPN) lack of commitment from some educators and learners laissez-faire attitude learner transport social ills and constant training of educators. But for the current academic year we will set high standards the department said.Here is its plan:1.Strengthen the Provincial Academic Improvement Plan and set new targets for 2017.2.Improve overall school functionality. 3.Make time on task and task on time a non-negotiable.4.Put systems in place to improve learner attainment in lower grades with specific focus on exit grades5.Learner-centred interventions.6.Boot camps for under-performing schools.7.Strict monitoring of curriculum management and curriculum coverage.
