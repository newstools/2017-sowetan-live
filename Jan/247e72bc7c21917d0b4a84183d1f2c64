Despite a looming legal battle with Shakes Mashaba, the South African Football Association (Safa) is confident the former Bafana Bafana coach has no leg to stand on.Mashaba, pictured, who was axed last month by the association following a disciplinary hearing, is taking his former employers to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) in a battle that could get messy.The 66-year-old was sacked after he was found guilty of gross misconduct, insubordination and violating Safa's communications policy.He is seeking to be reinstated as national coach and his representatives have written a letter to Safa requesting that they do not hire a new Bafana coach while the matter is being resolved.Mashaba will seek compensation if his wish to return to the hot seat does not materialise."I can't say if we have received the letter because we open office [for the new year] only on Monday," said Safa's communications manager Dominic Chimhavi yesterday."We will be advised by our attorneys on a way forward. The coach was taken to the DC and it found him guilty. We had a legal process which was overseen by a high court judge. It was transparent and we all know the outcome. We did everything above board."Mashaba did not receive a settlement on the remainder of his R500000-per-month contract after being axed.His legal representative wants to claim compensation which could amount to just over R5-million, should he not be reinstated. He was to exit the post after the 2018 Fifa World Cup.Since Mashaba's axing, CVs have been flooding in from coaches all over the world. Safa, however, will not make a hasty appointment as they look for a man who will help the team reach new heights. Chimhavi, however, did not want to reveal any names."We have seen several applications for the position from across the globe. When they come through, I forward them to the CEO [Dennis Mumble]. I am sure he has also received applications from many coaches."
