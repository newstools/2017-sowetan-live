Any chance of respected coach Brendan Venter working with the Springboks in the near future ended yesterday after he committed to a coaching role with Italy until after the 2019 World Cup.Venter who successfully coached England club side Saracens and took the Sharks to the Currie Cup title as an interim coach was Italy s defence coach last November when they famously beat the Springboks 20-18 in Florence. The Azzuri s stubborn defence was the foundation of their first victory over one of the southern hemisphere s big three earning Venter praise from Italy coach Conor O Shea. The Italian Rugby Federation confirmed Venter s role in a press statement on Monday. "I played and worked with Brendan at London Irish in the past " O'Shea said. "I believe that this agreement is the best it can be for us and for him. Brendan has had a great impact on the group [in November]. "We are excited to be working with him for years to come. He's a coach that is respected by the whole international community and we are proud that he wants to join our project with Italy until the next World Cup." - TMG Digital
