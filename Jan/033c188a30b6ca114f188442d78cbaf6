At least one classroom and a staffroom stockpiled with new stationery for the 2017 school year were gutted by fire after a rural Dutywa school in the Eastern Cape town of Dutywa was struck by lightning.Circuit manager in the Dutywa education district Ntsikelelo Jadezweni said that a staffroom full of books including textbooks had been the first to be struck by lightning at Vulingcobo Senior Secondary School in Chizele village.The incident reportedly took place around 6pm on Sunday. It [fire] then spread to another class which also burnt. Unfortunately the school is far removed from the community and located in a secluded veld which made it difficult for villagers to get there on time said Jadezweni.Two years ago the Daily Dispatch reported the plight of Vulingcobo which despite celebrating turning 30 years had little to celebrate as classrooms constructed from old prefab material were starting to crumble.At the time it was also reported that more than 500 pupils were forced to relieve themselves in open fields as there were no toilets at the school.Sunday s tragic incident took place about the same time that four people were killed when a bolt of lightning struck a church in Tsomo including the head reverend shortly after a Sunday sermon.
