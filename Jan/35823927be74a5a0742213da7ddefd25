Cape Town City chairman John Comitis says he would not sell his star players Lebogang Manyama and Aubrey Ngoma for anything under a combined fee of R30-million.The deadly duo renewed their contracts with the club yesterday, a move that will keep them in the Mother City outfit until 2021.This is a clear sign that City are looking to build a solid team for sustainable success.Manyama, 26, the team captain, and Ngoma, 27, have been in fine form this season, playing a massive role in their historic Telkom Knockout triumph last month.Comitis, who is well-versed when it comes to the domestic player market, said he is only interested in selling his top players to overseas clubs."I would not sell these players for anything under R30-million. I am only interested in [selling to] overseas clubs. No South African money can buy the players," said Comitis, who profited handsomely from player transfers during his days at Ajax Cape Town.After buying the status of Mpumalanga Black Aces, some players were not keen to move to Cape Town, but it's clear they are happy with how things have turned out since City's relocation.Comitis revealed the contract renewals have inspired even Lehlohonolo Majoro."I think what's important is that the players were happy to sign the contracts. They believe this club is going somewhere. It's a message to other players that if you perform, then you will get a contract," Comitis said."I got a message from Majoro saying 'I am motivated'. He can see that we are serious about what we are doing."
