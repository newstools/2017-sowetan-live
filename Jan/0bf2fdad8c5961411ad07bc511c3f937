Unlike most sports stars who took advantage of the festive season to earn a well-deserved break, it was a different case with marathon king Lusapho April.The 34-year-old wants to live up to expectations as one of the country's foremost road runners and he has already laid down a marker.He started the new year on a positive note, clinching the Nutribullet Bay to Bay 30km race in Cape Town in 1hr:36min:10sec on Sunday."Running the 30km was a matter of trying to build my confidence leading to the big events this year, especially the world championships [in London in August]," he told Sowetan yesterday.He ran well within the SA record pace in the early stages but faded. However, April held on to edge Ettiene Plaatjies of Nedbank Running Club by 36 seconds, while Givemore Mudzinganyama of Asics finished third (1:38:38)."I didn't take a break because I want to be ready for my qualifying race [for the world championships]. My [management] team is still finalising the details but it will be somewhere in Europe around April," said the Oxford Striders runner, hinting that he'd do other shorter races, with another 30km on the cards in Japan."It is going to be a long season but with my age and experience, I could still deliver and run under 2:08," he added, in reference to his personal best in the 42km."When Hendrick Ramaala retired, I put my hand up as someone to take over and I still believe I have it my legs to emulate his success."
