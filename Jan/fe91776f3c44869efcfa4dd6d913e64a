French star Jo-Wilfried Tsonga says he is targeting a spot in the top 10 as his new year goal after knee injuries hampered his 2016 season.The popular player has slipped to 12th in the rankings after reaching a career-high five and is keen to get back into the groove with a solid showing at the Australian Open next week. Last year was difficult for me, I didn t play that much, just 13 or 14 tournaments, he said after beating Borna Coric 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) in an exhibition match at the Kooyong Classic. So the challenge for me this year is to play a little bit more and to be able to have a better ranking. I want to be seeded in the big tournaments and then get some good results, the top 10 naturally (is a goal) but the top eight if I can of course because you re a little bit protected in the big tournaments. Tsonga made the Australian Open final in 2008 and is keen for another deep run at the tournament. That s what I needed, he said after spening 79 minutes on court in summer sunshine. I played indoors last week and had three matches so it was good to play a match this week also to get ready for Monday or Tuesday. Meanwhile, China s Qiang Wang finished third in the newly re-instated women s competition at Kooyong, beating Australian teen Destanee Aiava 6-4, 7-5.The women s final will be played between Belgian Yanina Wickmayer and Sorana Cirstea of Romania on Friday.The concluding session will also feature the men s decider between holder David Goffin of Belgium and Croat Ivo Karlovic.
