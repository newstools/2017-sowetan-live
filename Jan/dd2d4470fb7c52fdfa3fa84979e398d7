Defending champion and top seed Milos Raonic cruised into the quarterfinals of the Brisbane International with a regulation 6-3, 6-2 win over Argentine Diego Schwartzman yesterday.Raonic, who beat Roger Federer to win the 2016 Brisbane title, will now take on Rafael Nadal today (11am) for a place in the semifinals after the Spaniard crushed Germany's Mischa Zverev 6-1, 6-1.Raonic broke Schwartzman once in the first set and three times in the second to wrap up the match in 69 minutes, but said he wasn't happy with his start."At the beginning I really struggled that first service game. I have to be glad with how I finished," Raonic said.Nadal wasted no time in his 55 minute demolition of Zverev to the delight of the packed crowd in Pat Rafter Arena.The 14-time Grand Slam singles winner gave Zverev no chance, blasting 30 winners across the two sets and making only seven unforced errors.Nadal was troubled by illness and injury in 2016 and said he was thrilled to be back on court fully fit."After injuries and hard times it's so special to be back on court," he said."Tomorrow [today against Raonic] it's going to be a very hard match."He likes this court and he's had some good results here. I hope to play at my best and if I do I'll have a good chance."
