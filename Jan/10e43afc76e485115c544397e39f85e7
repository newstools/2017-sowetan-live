The North West department of education may have to pay more than R200000 to a teacher, in addition to R228958.43 it paid while the teacher was away on leave for 11 months.This is the recommendation by the Public Service Commission (PSC), after it ruled that the department did not follow proper procedure to deny Bertha Raikane, 58, further income after her 11-month ill-health leave ended.The former Grade 1 teacher at Motlhabe Primary School in Moses Kotane municipality took the department to the commission after it told her that her leave was mistakenly approved.Raikane submitted her early retirement letter when she returned from her leave for depression. Her request for early retirement was approved by the department in December 2015. But, she was later told by the department that an independent consultant had suggested that she had faked her illness.She said the department told her that its consultant said her doctor's notes were invalid and that, because she was faking her illness, she had to pay back R228958.43 the department had paid her for the 11 months she had been off sick.Raikane said she was told to pay back this money before her request for early retirement could be granted . She stayed home without further salary for the whole of 2016 and in the meantime reported her case to the Public Service Commission.In a letter dated October 20 2016, the PSC's provincial director KGB Sedibe asked the department to investigate Raikane's leave in 2014/15, and determine if she had properly submitted the leave form.The PSC further said it should also investigate whether Raikane was in possession of the medical certificates and adjust her time off from work to the correct leave type, if discrepancies were found. Informed by the facts in front of it, the commission ruled that Raikane's leave application was in order, and so was its approval by the department.The PSC dismissed the department's demand for Raikane to pay back the monies she earned during her leave. The commission also recommended that Raikane be regarded as an employee until the department conducted proper investigations around the status of her position.The PSC said her payment was done after the department's head had approved a doctor's recommendations that Raikane was unfit to stand in front of pupils and not fit enough to drive her car.She has been working for the department for 30 years.The PSC recommended that the department pay her 2016 salaries, a sum estimated to be over R240000, apologise to her for the financial hardship and psychological suffering that she went through and withdraw her ill-health retirement.The PSC also recommended that the employee assistance programme should immediately be started with Raikane and her family for counselling and submit the report to the head of the department on a monthly basis.Education department spokesman Freddy Sepeng promised to respond last week and Sowetan tried again to get hold of him yesterday but his cellphone was off.Efforts to get hold of MEC Sello Lehari were also not successful.The family of a teacher who is battling to get paid while on sick leave said her condition had become worse.Bertha Raikane's husband Victor Raikane said his wife was getting more depressed every day, and the family could no longer afford her medication."The medication is the only thing that keeps her sane, I cannot afford to buy it any more," he said.The unemployed husband said he spent R1100 last month alone for his wife's medication.His family survives on the allowance that their eldest child gives them monthly.He said the bank also threatened to repossess their car last month, and that was putting more strain on his wife."I don't know what to do any more, we have submitted all the doctor's reports to the department but they are still refusing to pay her," he said yesterday.His wife was not in a position to talk to Sowetan yesterday, only saying the people who had wronged her were those from the department."This is how she reacts of late, we don't know how to deal with her sometimes, we do not even have enough money to send her to a psychiatric institution," her husband said.The North West department of education had not responded at the time of going to print. MEC Sello Lehari was also not available for comment.
