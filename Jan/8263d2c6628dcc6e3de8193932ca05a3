Ten weeks after SABMiller shareholders gave the go-ahead for the third-largest merger in corporate history Anheuser Busch InBev (AB InBev) sent out a voluntary severance offer to more than 1 000 of its management employees in SA.This is the first time in recent history that South African Breweries has undertaken a retrenchment exercise on any scale. Plant modernisation in the 1980s was the cause of the last round of retrenchments. The group s been in expansion mode since then so retrenchment was never on the cards said a former executive.A memo was issued on December 12 which had a January 20 deadline to accept what one recipient said was a very generous offer . A reminder was sent out 12 days ago just days after many of the managers had returned to their desks after their year-end break. The deadline has been extended. - TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE
