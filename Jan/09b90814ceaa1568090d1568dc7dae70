Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Thursday confirmed that they had reached a mutual agreement with fast bowler Kyle Abbott to terminate his contract with immediate effect after he signed a Kolpak contract with Hampshire for the 2017 season onwards.CSA also indicated that they were in consultation with batsman Rilee Rossouw who also confirmed on Thursday that he had committed himself to a similar contract with the same English county side.As a result both Rossoue and Abbott will no longer be considered for any future Proteas selection. Regrettably we have no option but to severe our ties with both Abbott and Rossouw as they are no longer available for South Africa said CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat. It is a disappointing day not just for South African cricket but also for international cricket as these players have given up their opportunity to be seen in action on the international circuit."From CSA s perspective it is a loss as we invest immeasurable amounts which include premium time finance technical high performance coaching followed by development tours and providing general player welfare over a long period of time."By way of example Rilee has spent a lengthy period on the injury list while we spared no expense in providing him with the best medical support said Lorgat. Both Rilee and Kyle have been given opportunities over the past year to play at the highest level and were firmly in our plans for the future."We have encouraged Rilee and Kyle to reconsider their decisions but both have indicated that they wish to take up Kolpak contracts."Whilst this is a loss for South African cricket we can only wish them well with their overseas careers."We will continue to invest heavily in our local talent and provide opportunities for those individuals who wish to realize their dream of playing for their country we will not contract players who do not commit to play for South Africa. Abbott said he was delighted to be joining Hampshire and the decision to turn his back on the country was the most difficult. Making the decision to commit my long term future to Hampshire was undoubtedly the most difficult one I have ever had to make and I leave with more than a little sadness knowing that I won t represent the Proteas again."Representing my country was undoubtedly the biggest honour in my career and I am very thankful for the opportunity to have represented South Africa and the Proteas said Abbott.Rossouw also confirmed that he had signed a three year old contract with Hampshire and he thought long and hard about that decision. Deciding to leave South Africa is something I have thought long and hard about and moving to England will give me and my family the long term career security that I believe is important at this stage of my life."I have loved representing the Proteas and will watch from afar with great affection every time they take the field from now on but I am hugely dedicated to making Hampshire cricket successful on the field."I would like to express my thanks to Cricket South Africa for the opportunity to represent my country and also for the Knights for their continued support. he said. - TMG Digital
