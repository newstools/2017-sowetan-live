Polokwane City have bolstered their squad ahead of the second round of the league with the signing of Tlou Segolela along with Zambian defensive midfielder Salulani Phiri and defender Mohau Tshehla.Segolela who has impressed City coach Luc Eymael during his month-long trial joined as a free agent after the former Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates winger was released by Platinum Stars last season.The 22-year-old Phiri a long-time target for Rise and Shine joined from Zambian giants Zanaco while Tshehla was recruited from National First Division promotion-chasers Witbank Spurs City communications and media manager Noko Moloto confirmed to TMG Digital on Thursday.Phiri has only just returned to training in December after a three-month stint on the sidelines with a tendon injury but will have ample time to fully recover as the Absa Premiership only resumes in early February. We are pleased with the addition of these exciting young players we have signed ahead of the second round of the season said Moloto who declined to disclose the length of the trio s contracts though Zambian media has reported Phiri signed on a three-year deal. The signings are in line with our ambition of finishing in the top five and we believe that with the additions of these players and possibly more to come we can realise our goal. They ll join the team when the squad resume training. Like every player in our team they ll be expected to work hard to earn their places in the team. No one is guaranteed a place in the side said Moloto.City are placed fifth on the Premier Soccer League log standings with 21 points after 15 matches just four points behind leaders SuperSport United.The trio are expected to be available for selection when City host Maritzburg United on February 9. - TMG Sport
