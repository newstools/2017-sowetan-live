The Clever Boys are apparently also interested in former Ajax captain Granwald Scott, who is unsettled at Slovakian side Slovan Bratislava.One of NFD side Royal Eagles' best players this season, Raymond Monama, who has scored nine goals for the KZN side, has attracted interest from Bloemfontein Celtic and it is thought that he may either move now or sign a pre-contract to join next season.SuperSport United midfielder David Mathebula is said to be on his way to Baroka as he has been deemed to be surplus to requirement by the Tshwane side.
