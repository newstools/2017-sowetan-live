Winger Tlou Segolela has vowed to hit the ground running at his hometown club, Polokwane City."Gautrain" is the first to admit that his statistics from his last club, Platinum Stars don't make for good reading.Segolela, 28, started 11 matches for "Dikwena" last season, came off the bench five times and scored just one goal.So it comes as no surprise that the Moletjie, Limpopo-born winger feels he has something to prove after penning an 18-month deal with "Rise and Shine"."I just want to forget about last season; cancel it. It was one of those disappointments, though I was pleased to be a part of Platinum Stars. They are a team with great facilities and the environment is great," Segolela told Sowetan yesterday.He may not have made much of an impact at Stars, especially last season, but he is eager to prove his worth. More so since he remains a popular figure among the fans."People still stop me at [shopping] malls and talk to me. It shows that they are missing me, but I know it will require a lot of hard work to get back to my best. I know what I'm capable of," he said.Most importantly, the former Orlando Pirates attacking midfielder is looking forward to helping City maintain their good form this season. They are currently fifth on the log after 15 matches."I'm obviously happy to have joined Polokwane City and at the same time reunite with my family," continued Segolela, who is now in his 10th PSL season.Segolela feels he has a big role to play at the club because of his experience."If you look at my [body] structure, I'm even better than those that have been playing [since the beginning of the season]," said Segolela, who played eight Bafana Bafana matches at the height of his career.He is hopeful that City will continue to punch above their weight.
