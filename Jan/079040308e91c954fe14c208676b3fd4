Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates's performances this season have left a lot to be desired and they risk finishing the season empty-handed again.The Soweto giants both finished without any silverware last season, and as it stands there is a strong possibility that the same will happen this campaign.To say the supporters of the two clubs are disappointed would be an understatement.This is where Chiefs and Pirates need to improve to do better in the second half of the season:CHIEFSMany Amakhosi supporters believe that coach Steve Komphela is the main problem at the club and that a new coach could bring in fresh ideas to steer the team forward.Maybe that has a ring of truth to it, but you also can't ignore the fact that Chiefs' top scorer in all competitions is a defender - Lorenzo Gordinho with three goals.Either Chiefs will have to buy a proven goal scorer - who will be hard to find at this time of year - otherwise the likes of Michelle Katsvairo, Lewis Macha and Edward Manqele will have to come to the party.With only 12 goals conceded in 15 games, Chiefs have some positives to take out of their first half of the season.However, they can do better in the final third which will help in getting positive results on a consistent basis.PIRATESBefore anything, Bucs will have to appoint a permanent coach who will have to hit the ground running in order to turn things around at the club.Pirates started the season with Muhsin Ertugral, but the Turk resigned early in November after they were thumped 6-1 by SuperSport United.Augusto Palacios has been in charge, albeit on a caretaker basis. Also of great concern for Bucs should be the team's overreliance on striker Tendai Ndoro.The Zimbabwean has scored 11 of Pirates' 15 league goals this season, while other strikers like Thabiso Kutumela, Thamsanqa Gabuza and Ayanda Nkosi have contributed very little.The defence, too, has not stayed the same, especially in the centre where the likes of Justice Chabalala, Ayanda Gcaba, Happy Jele and Edwin Gyimah have featured.Pirates, as a result, have conceded 17 league goals which is only three less than bottom-placed Baroka.
