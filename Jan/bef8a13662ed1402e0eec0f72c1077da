Lumka Oliphant said her expletive-laden rant in defence of Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini was unfortunate and regrettable but said she couldn t leave claims that she had addressed South Africa drunk unchallenged. She took to Facebook and said that people can say whatever you want to say on her politics when you do not agree with her but added don t s*** about her . She told Radio 702 on Monday morning that the malicious rumours about Dlamini s alleged drinking habits had been circulating since last year. Oliphant s outburst came in the wake of a recent Citizen report that said the minister reportedly used a microphone stand when standing and sitting down and quoted observers saying she seemed unsteady on her feet at an event in Germiston.She took to Facebook and said that people can say whatever you want to say on her politics when you do not agree with her but added don t s*** about her .Oliphant taunted the media saying: Anyone of you who wish to use this post for your articles go the f*** ahead! Yes the f*** ahead! I have decided to take this alcohol matter to the gutter where you have taken it. On Monday Oliphant stressed that Dlamini did not drink alcohol and actually devoted her time to fighting social ills caused by its abuse. TMG Digital
