After spending 27 years and 11 months in prison, former Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla) cadre Kenny Motsamai will finally be free next week.He will be released on January 11. Motsamai was released on day parole seven months ago - he leaves the Boksburg Prison each day at 8am and returns at 4pm. His movements are monitored through an Israeli-made tracking device."I'll be free on the 11th," Motsamai said yesterday.Correctional services department spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo confirmed Motsamai's day parole was lapsing.But Nxumalo only said Motsamai could be released on the day pending the parole board's decision."Before the 11th, he should know [the board's determination]."Motsamai is one of the political veterans who will get state-funded houses this weekend.Motsamai and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) have always maintained that he was one of the political prisoners still imprisoned in the country. They have argued that the murder Motsamai was convicted of in 1989 happened during the struggle against apartheid.Aged 26 at the time, Motsamai was imprisoned for killing a white traffic officer in Rustenburg during an Apla-sanctioned bank robbery. At the time, he had just returned from Ethiopia after military training.Scores of anti-apartheid activists convicted during apartheid were released in the 1990s after getting amnesty from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.Apartheid operatives who could prove their actions were sanctioned by the state were also let off free.Motsamai has been staying at his wife's home in Katlehong, east of Johannesburg, since his release on day parole."I'm very happy that they've given me a house. Not having a shelter is like not having land, somebody can chase you away at any time."The PAC has ensured that after my release I'll go straight to my own house," Motsamai said.PAC spokesman Kenneth Mokgatlhe said Motsamai's house in Daveyton, also east of Johannesburg, had been built through a housing programme between political parties and the military veterans department."Motsamai was prioritised because he cannot find a job because he has just been released from prison. We had to prioritise him."Mokgatlhe said other PAC veterans set to get houses in Daveyton include renowned poet Don Mattera and Johnson Mlambo, the party's former chairman.Spokesman for the military veterans department Mbulelo Musi yesterday said he did not readily know if Motsamai was part of those who will get houses this weekend."It shouldn't be surprising," he said. "One can get those details about Motsamai [today]."But across the board there are many [housing] projects prioritising military veterans."
