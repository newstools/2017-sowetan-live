Walking like a video vixen or Victoria's Secret model gives you confidence and makes you victorious, compared to walking slow and slumpy."He said the walking trend on fashion ramps is all about taking a longer stride, while picking one foot to take over from the other."Ntando's strength is her dominant left foot, which is unlike most South African girls. This not only makes her unique but also competitive as this is a popular stride on the international modelling scene."Seboko and Kunene met in 2013, when he was part of the training team at Miss Mpumalanga in Nelspruit. The beauty queen chose Seboko to train her because of the personal relationship that was forged back then.Her training regime involved finding the perfect wardrobe, a killer walk, and being mentally aware of the current socioeconomic affairs of the country and the world.Kunene is confident about doing better than she did at Miss World where she didn't place. "Miss World and Miss Universe are two different pageants. Miss Universe focuses on an elegant, smart woman and I am confident that I am all of that."She said it was crucially important that she brings this crown home for the first time in the new South Africa. "We have a Miss World post-1994. It would be great to add Miss Universe." She leaves this morning for the Philippines.masemolam@sowetan.co.za
