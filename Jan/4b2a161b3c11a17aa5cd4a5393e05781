Prophet Bongani Maseko of Daveyton's Breath of Christ Ministries is making his congregation drink engine cleaning fluid all in the name of 'healing' and 'delivering'.This comes just weeks after reports of a pastor spraying members of his church with an insecticide emerged.This was one of the many incidents that have rocked the country recently.Pictures on the Breath of Christ Ministries' Facebook page show members of the church consuming contents of a black bottle with words 'Formula A'. Contents in the bottle have been said to be that of an engine cleaning fluid."Yes it is true [contents are engine cleaning fluid]. The purpose is for healing and deliverance and it's a demonstration of the power of God," he said.Prophet Maseko said that he did not do any research on the dangers that could come with his congregation consuming the engine cleaning fluid, he said he merely just prayed that it will do what he wanted it to do."I didn't do any research because anything that you pray over can turn into anything you want," he said adding that he only needed faith in God and to believe that it will work.Asked how he measures how successful the engine cleaning fluid is, he said that he does not have to measure because "people come forward and testify. Their testimony is how I measure."Prophet Maseko said he did not see anything wrong with what he was doing as no one had been admitted to hospital for consuming the fluid."No one was ever admitted to any hospital, no one has ever seen a doctor. These people simply get delivered."Commission for Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Religious, Cultural and Linguistic Communities chairperson Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva could not be reached but according to IOL - who reported on the same story - she was livid and called on religious leaders to bring an end to abuse of Christianity.
