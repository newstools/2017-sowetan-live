The SA Football Association will convene a meeting for their technical committee to begin and discuss the search for a new coach.Despite being asked not to hire a new coach by axed Shakes Mashaba's representatives, Safa are going ahead in finding a new man to occupy a seat that has proven to be too hot to handle for many who have sat in it.The meeting, according to a statement that was sent out by Safa yesterday, will "develop proposed principles of engagement for a new head coach, including defining an updated mandate and other requirements for presentation to the Safa national executive committee (NEC)".Safa president Danny Jordaan is currently in Gabon ahead of the start of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, but will be back in South Africa next week to address the coaching matter with chief executive Dennis Mumble as well as the Safa technical committee.
