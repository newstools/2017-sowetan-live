The reporter Pumza Fihlani got this information from the WHO s 2014 report on alcohol and health for the period 2008 to 2010.The WHO s figures are based on a three-year average of recorded alcohol consumption from production import/export and sales statistics and on unrecorded intake using Food and Agriculture Organisation statistics and various modelling techniques.South Africa: 11.0 litresGabon: 10.9 litresNamibia: 10.8 litresNigeria: 10:1 litresRwanda: 9.8 litresUganda: 9.8 litresBurundi: 9.3 litresSierra Leone: 8.7 litresBotswana: 8.4 litresCameroon: 8.4 litresSource: WHO. The litres of pure alcohol are derived from the alcohol content of the drinks for example a 5.5% alcohol content means you ll take in 41.25ml of pure alcohol in 750ml.The graph shows that South Africans older than 15 drank the equivalent of 11 litres of pure alcohol a year. The continent s average is 4.66 litres.On average South Africans consume between 10 and 12.4 litres of pure alcohol a person a year according to local figures.This is between 500 and 620 glasses of wine or between 1 000 and 1 240 shots of spirit a person annually.Africa Check noted the health implications of excessive drinking: Given that South Africa Namibia and Botswana feature among the heaviest drinkers it is no surprise that Southern African has the highest number of people dying of disease caused by alcohol intake in the African region.
