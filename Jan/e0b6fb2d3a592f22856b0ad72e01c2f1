As was the case with Portuguese-based Bongani Zungu, Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane knows that he cannot stand in the way of Keagan Dolly if the player wants to move overseas.But Mosimane, who feels Dolly is not ready to play abroad, said they would be able to replace the flying winger should he make a move to Europe this month or at the end of the season.Dolly had challenged Sundowns through the league's Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) on a matter relating to a European buyout clause in his contract, which expires in June 2019.Dolly's buyout clause is now back at R25-million after the DRC ruled in favour of Sundowns, who claim they made a "mistake" by changing it to R10.5-million last year.The player has attracted interests from Greek giants Olympiakos and French side Montpellier, but Mosimane said he did not know when the player will move."We have to continue with our lives. If Keagan has to go, he has to go. We lost Zungu. We lost Killer [Katlego] Mphela, we lost [Elias] Pelembe. You will lose some of these players and that's normal."Yes we might lose him, but if we lose him we will be ready to replace him."I don't know [when he will leave]," said Mosimane, who feels Dolly needs one more season in the PSL to improve certain parts of his game."He is not ready. He needs one more year. But when you say that, people say you want to delay the player."If he has an opportunity to move overseas, then he must take it."[But] I work with him and he knows why I say that. He needs to work on some parts of his game. I have played football in Europe, they are not patient," added Mosimane, who attended the CAF awards in Abuja, Nigeria, last night.Even though Dolly challenged Sundowns through the DRC, Mosimane has kept on playing the winger.Dolly, in return, continues to give his best on the pitch, which shows there's no animosity between them.
