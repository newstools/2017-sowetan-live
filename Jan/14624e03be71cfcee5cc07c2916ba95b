You would think Pitso Mosimane would be content with what he has achieved in the past year: CAF coach of the year; Champions League winner and a record-breaking Absa Premiership championship.But, as he departed for holiday yesterday, the Mamelodi Sundowns coach promised to strive to scale even greater heights in the coming months.Mosimane was named the best coach on the continent by CAF last week."There's so much to do still, so much to achieve," he said, as he prepared to go on what he called a "well-deserved" family holiday after a hectic past 12 months."We may have won the [CAF] Champions League, but we didn't do well at the Fifa Club World Cup."I think we have to aim to go back, and the only way to do that is to first win the Premiership, then the Champions League," he said.But Mosimane and his charges face another tough year with a very demanding schedule.Sundowns are six games behind in the league programme and, next month, must face off against TP Mazembe in the CAF Super Cup. Then there's also the Nedbank Cup to come, with the Champions League kicking off in February.The current break in domestic action, due to the Africa Cup of Nations starting this weekend, has come in handy for Mosimane, who has given his men leave until January 18 to recuperate."We have not had off-season," he said. "We played in June and July while other teams were on break. But when we come back on January 18, I'm confident that we'll be at the required level to compete for the league title."If we can't win it, then we have to be runners-up because I want us to be in the Champions League."We have to go back to the Club World Cup and do better than we did in December. We need to improve and show that the standard of SA football can match global trends."Sundowns face Bloemfontein Celtic on February 8 as they play catch-up with the league programme.
