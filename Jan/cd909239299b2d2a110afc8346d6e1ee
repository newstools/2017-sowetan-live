All-round consistency was the key to South Africa's 3-0 thumping of hapless Sri Lanka during their test series that ended at the Wanderers Stadium on Saturday.The test series will be followed by the three-match T20 series that starts at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Friday afternoon.Speaking after they wrapped up the third test with two days to spare in Johannesburg, Proteas captain Faf du Plessis said their whitewash performance was not the best under his leadership but the most consistent, where they executed their plans almost to perfection."I won't say it's the best, I think it's the most consistent and that's something we've asked for right at the start of the series," he said.Du Plessis added that throughout the 13 days of test cricket against the Sri Lankans, they were in control for probably 95% of the time." Bowling and batting right through the series was consistent and also fielding."Du Plessis also praised the fast bowlers who were relentless against a largely inexperienced Sri Lankan batting line-up."We know that Kagiso Rabada and Vernon Philander are world-class bowlers, they are delivering every game and they're consistent and relentless."Now the plan is to make sure that our third seamer can get to that level and hopefully as quickly as possible. "Both of them will say that they possibly leaked a few too many runs in this game, but that they got wickets."Duanne Olivier had some nice pace and aggression which is always good to see in a test attack and Wayne Parnell with his left arm offered some nice pace as well," he added. - TMG Digital
