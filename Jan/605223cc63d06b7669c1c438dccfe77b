The case against two men accused of beating and forcing Victor Mlotshwa into a coffin was yesterday postponed to March."Gentlemen, this case is now postponed ... for first appearance on 23 March 2017, and you will both appear at the regional court," said magistrate Jongilizwe Dumehleli.Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson will remain in custody as they were denied bail in the Middelburg Magistrate's Court in Mpumalanga on December 8.In their first court appearance, the two decided they would not apply for bail because they feared they would be attacked after the public outcry against their alleged assault on Mlotshwa.The two later decided to apply for bail but were unsuccessful.In a 20-second video clip that went viral, trending under #CoffinAssault on social media, one of the men can be seen forcing Mlotshwa into a coffin while his accomplice threatens to set it alight.As they attempted to close the coffin with him inside, Mlotshwa could be heard crying.The incident was filmed at JM de Beer Boerdery next to Komati Power Station near Middelburg.The pair has been charged with kidnapping, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice.The magistrate said the incident was clearly racially motivated.Meanwhile, NPA provincial spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa said the case might be moved to regional court for trial. - TMG Digital
