The pain that Premier Boxing League organiser Dicksy Ngqula caused to four boxers is coming to haunt him, warns Boxing SA chief executive Tsholofelo Lejaka.Lejaka was reacting to news that Stan Fanaroff - an attorney who represented PBL overall winner Xolisani Ndongeni - won the case against the beleaguered Ngqula.Fanaroff told Sowetan that the South Gauteng High Court liquidated Ngqula's PBL on Tuesday.This means that PBL's asserts or property face attachment.Fanaroff explained: "The next step is the secret inquiry where we will cross-examine Dicksy so that he tells the court how does his company trade without any reasonable prospects of paying debts."We want to find out if PBL was trading recklessly with no reasonable prospects in which directors can be personally held liable."Fanaroff said after suing Ngqula a year ago, he offered to pay R600000 at a go and R100000 per month. "We sued him again and he defended the action but we won the case on Tuesday - hence the final liquidation order on Tuesday."Lejaka said: "We welcome steps taken by Ndongeni's lawyers and the findings by the court. We are also coming to inflict more pain on Dicksy."Ngqula still owes R1.6-million - Ndongeni (R1m), Mabhuti Sinyabi, Toto Helebe and Makazole Tete (all R200 000 each).Several attempts to get hold of Ngqula yesterday were unsuccessful. He told Sowetan last year that: "There is no rule which says prize money must be paid on a specific date."
