Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande has instructed his department to convene a technical vocational education and training (TVET) forum to create a open frank quick and effective channel of communication.He said this ongoing forum seeks to bring students representatives college administrators as well as senior officials from his ministry to the table.The minister said he has also requested his director-deneral Gwebinkundla Qonde to set up an intervention task team to speed up the process of current initiatives being implemented to improve the quality of teaching and learning at TVET colleges. TVET colleges headed for total shutdown We recently received a list of grievances from the body representing TVET students. We take this list and the students body very seriously he said.Last week the SA Further Education and Training Students Association (Safetsa) threatened to shut down 50 of the country s colleges and called for the department to intervene in the critical issues the sector was grappling with. Minister calls on college students to protest peacefully It cited weak leadership corruption unqualified lecturers lack of certification and student support as factors that have collapsed the sector. There is nothing in the memorandum we have received from Safetsa that cannot be resolved with a bit of goodwill and determination by the TVET colleges of course supported by the DHET he said.Speaking in Pretoria on Thursday Nzimande invited students to be part of this effort to get things right.He said the government s commitment to the higher education cause is demonstrated in part by the substantial increases in funding to National Student Financial Aid Scheme since 2010. We remain committed to finding the resources to support the children of all poor working-class and middle-class families in their quest to better their lives and those of their families through skills acquisition Nzimande said.
