When the traditional Venda fist fighter enters the ring, the crowd in a Limpopo village eagerly shouts "MTG".Eddmore "MTG" Mahlako is a musangwe bare-knuckle fighter; he is dark, muscular and has a charming smile.He gets into the ring, takes off his shirt but leaves his black undershirt with the words "MTG Funerals" written in yellow.That's the 21-year-old's nickname."When people started to take note of my ring style, they noticed the writing on my T-shirt and they started calling me MTG," Mahlako said.Musangwedates back three centuries. Today it's largely based at Tshifudi village near Thohoyandou, where males from the age of nine can challenge peers to fight for pride and respect.It was in 2013 when Mahlako overcame his fright to fight in a musangwe tournament."I was afraid, but after few punches I could see that I was defeating my opponent, then I started to relax. I had no one cheering me because I was a nobody then. I battled with him [opponent] till he surrendered," he said.He earned his name last year October after winning a trophy and two medals during a tournament in Louis Trichardt.According to musangwe president Tshilidzi "Poison" Ndevana, mysticism is part of the sport, with rituals being performed by the fighters before each event.Mahlako, however, said he viewed musangwe like any other sport.He said he now wants to use his skills to become a professional boxer.Mahlako said if his hunt for a boxing trainer went well, he would be pursuing the career this year."My dream is to be a professional boxer. From next month, I will be looking for a trainer so that I can fulfil my dream."If all goes well for Mahlako, he may just go on to become the next boxing champion from Venda, after the likes of Phillip Ndou and Muvhuso Nedzanani.ndlovusa@sowetan.co.za
