Alexandra Black Aces co-chairmen, Mario and George Morfou, have registered their disappointment at "malicious allegations" circulating in the media that Zimbabwean team Chicken Inn have gone to Fifa for compensation over Tendai Ndoro's transfer.According to the Morfou brothers, certain media outlets have been reporting that Aces owe the Zimbabwean outfit 30% of the transfer fee after Ndoro was sold to Orlando Pirates in June 2015."Aces chairmen, Mario and George Morfou, were surprised and slightly agitated by the stories on football websites regarding the contractual dispute between Aces and Chicken Inn,'' the statement from Aces' website said."The matter between Aces, Ndoro and Chicken Inn was cleared by Fifa late last year. The claimant was given 10 days to appeal the decision and according to our knowledge they never did, meaning they accepted the ruling made by Fifa last November. The stories published over the weekend are one-sided and Aces does not owe Chicken Inn any money as everything was done by the book," said Mario.The dispute was apparently sparked by claims made by Chicken Inn that when they sold Ndoro to Aces in 2013, the contract had a clause stating that the Bulawayo-based outfit would get 30% of any future move made by Ndoro within a five-year period.The statement by Aces further said Chicken Inn tried to communicate this matter with the SA Football Association (Safa) but the federation did not give them "joy"."We have searched through our files but did not get anything about the Ndoro, Aces and Chicken Inn matter,'' Safa head of communications Dominic Chimhavi told Sowetan.
