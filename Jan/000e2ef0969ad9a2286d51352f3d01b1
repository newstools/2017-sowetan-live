Johannesburg twins Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie who stand accused of terrorism are due in court on Wednesday.The twins who face three counts related to alleged terrorism activities are currently being held in custody.They were arrested in Newclare in July in a police operation which involved several international policing agencies.The twins who have been charged for contravening the Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorist and Related Act will appear in the Johannesburg magistrates court.The Thulsies along with brother and sister Ebrahim and Fatima Patel are alleged to have planned to attack and blow up Jewish institutions and the US embassy in Gauteng. The attacks are said to be part of a mission they were allegedly carrying out on behalf of the Islamic State terrorist organisation.The court will rule on a three-month postponement application from the state in order for it to collect evidence from other countries including the US Britain Kenya Syria and Turkey.Prosecutor Chris MacAdam argued that as the Thulsies were in custody because they had voluntarily abandoned their bail applications the defence could therefore not claim a postponement violated their rights.
