Newlands is braced for the decider in the T20 series between South Africa and Sri Lanka on Wednesday.The day dawned bright and clear unlike Tuesday when drizzle came and went throughout the morning and afternoon and might well have added spice to the pitch.South Africans will be intent on seeing if AB de Villiers is over the elbow injury that has kept him out of national duty since June.Lankans will be less confident of victory than they might have been in the wake of their team s series-levelling win at the Wanderers on Saturday.The man who blasted them to that success Angelo Matthews is out with a hamstring injury.
