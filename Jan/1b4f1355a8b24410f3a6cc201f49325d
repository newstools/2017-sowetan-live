The ANC's public communication and campaigning around its January 8 celebrations has been a low-key affair, with President Jacob Zuma and his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa having not yet visited a single township in Gauteng this week.This is unprecedented as the top ANC leaders usually have a clear deployment plan and conduct door-to-door visits and hold mini-rallies in the week ahead of the weekend of its January 8 rally to celebrate the party's birthday.The January 8 rally is due to be held on Sunday at Orlando Stadium in Soweto to mark 105 years of the ANC's existence.Zuma is scheduled to deliver the party's programme of action for the year, known as the January 8 statement.This year's rally is being held in the province of Gauteng, whose leadership under provincial chairman Paul Mashatile is seen as hostile to Zuma's leadership.The party dropped support in Gauteng in the previous national election in 2014 and again in the municipal election last year after losing Tshwane and Johannesburg to a DA-led partnership with the EFF and other opposition parties.As part of the build-up to the January 8 rally, the party usually hosts a series of events and mini-rallies as leaders visit local communities to mobilise supporters to attend the main weekend event.But this year there has been little communication and the party's canvassing has not been visible.Unlike in previous years, Zuma had not visited any community in Gauteng by yesterday as he only arrived from KwaZulu-Natal on Wednesday.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said Zuma had tendered an apology for not taking part in their build-up programme.Zuma was expected to campaign in Soweto today despite being scheduled to host President Brahim Ghali of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic for a working visit in Pretoria.Ramaphosa had also not visited any community either.There was confusion yesterday when Ramaphosa's office in the Presidency issued a statement indicating that he would be visiting Tembisa today and Soweto tomorrow.However, the statement was withdrawn several hours later as Ramaphosa's office stated that he would no longer visit the two townships."We wish to advise you of the withdrawal of ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa's door-to-door media programme for Tembisa and Soweto ahead of the organisation's 105-years celebrations and January 8 statement that was released earlier today," read the statement.Asked to comment on Zuma and Ramaphosa's no-show, ANC national spokesman Zizi Kodwa said: "There is no conspiracy about it."He said they had been unable to campaign due to other government programmes.Mashatile said he had been campaigning in Tshwane but had to drop one activity in Atteridgeville for reasons he did not disclose.Mantashe said other ANC leaders such as treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize and deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte had been to the East Rand and the Vaal Triangle respectively.
