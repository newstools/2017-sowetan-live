Tovhowani Mulovhedzi, Thohoyandou Secondary School, Limpopo: Top learner in a quintile three school.One of the biggest challenges for Tovhowani Mulovhedzi, 17, was being focused and doing one thing at a time."I do tend to be all over the place sometimes. So, being organised was quite challenging because I wanted to do every single subject in a day and sometimes that got a little bit messy."The challenge made her lose hope that she would become a national top achiever, but the support she received from her parents, teachers and siblings kept her motivated and she was able to keep focus and do her best.Even though she came from a poor school that was not well-resourced, she managed to push herself and overca me whatever obstacles came her way."Our school is very poor. We don't even have school hall and a science lab, and science needs a lot of experiments and so we did not get to do most of them so we just flew by. At least we are living in a digital age so we used the internet. Fortunately, I had access to it through my phone and laptop at home," she said.Mulovhedzi will be studying medicine at the University of Pretoria.Quintile 1, 2 and 3 schools are no-fee paying schools and quintile 4 are fee-paying schools.Anelisa Marwanqana, Mariazell Senior Secondary School, Eastern Cape: Top learner in a quintile one schoolComing from a rural school with little resources in the Eastern Cape, Marwanqana did not think she would be one of the national top achievers.Marwanqana, 17, said her school, based in Matatiele, was far from town and did not even have access to the internet."We had few textbooks, few teachers and we're overcrowded. In my class alone I think we were about 50. And because we did not have the internet, which was a big challenge when wanting to research other things, I relied on the few textbooks we had and consulted teachers on things I did not understand."She said the call telling her she was one of the top achievers was unexpected."When the call came through the words that my teachers, fellow learners and friends who told me that I would make it to the top list of top achievers were the first to come to my mind."Marwanqana said her technique was studying smart, balancing her social life with her studies and getting enough rest.She said she started studying as early as January, and counts that as what helped her be counted as one of the top brains in the country.She will be studying actuarial science at Wits.Top pupil in a quintile three schoolMPHO Ramagoma was buried so deeply in her school books during her matric year that she postponed going to visit her grandmother in hospital, where she died."I felt bad because I was supposed to visit her in the hospital but there was too much school work and I felt bad. It disturbed me a bit," said Ramagoma.But even though her grandmother's death shook her, it did not stop her from continuing to bury herself in her books."I studied every day from the beginning of the year. I did not take a break."I made sure that every day I did something."I rested when I needed to by reading books because I enjoy reading, but I was studying every day," she said."I studied more on weekends because I had more time. I did not have any social life."And even though the only life the 18-year-old had during her matric year was her books, she did not think she had any hope of making it as a top achiever, especially after she had written her exams.Ramagoma said she had lost hope because some of the subjects were not that easy.She will study mechanical engineering at the University of Pretoria.Top pupil in a quintile one schoolAS SOON as Karabo Moremi, 18, found out that he passed Grade 11, he started studying for Grade 12.And as a headboy during his matric year he had thought he did not have enough time to study as he was occupied by other school duties. So being named as one of the top achievers came as a surprise to him.He calls his superlative achievement a "blessing from God"."I studied for a really short time given my other duties. Another advantage I used was that I helped other learners so when they asked me questions, like really difficult questions, that's when I really studied otherwise it was really pre-study," said Moremi from a school in a rural town of Mogwadi, 65km north of Polokwane.He said he also used school holidays and his free time to catch up on his studies. By the end of the third term he said he had finished studying and was focusing on his other duties."I feel blessed and humbled to be here today, I guess I'm now the popular kid on the block," he said.Moremi is going to study actuarial science either at University of Pretoria or University of Cape Town.Top pupil in a quintile three schoolNOT wanting to have regrets later in life is what pushed Siphokazi Hlalukana to study hard, but even when doing that she did not think her efforts would lead her to becoming a top pupil."I really was not expecting it, even when I got the call I could not believe it. It feels unreal. I still do not believe it," Hlalukana said."When you're studying you don't think of these things and want to do the best that you can. And now it turned out that the best that I did turned out to this."I wanted to do the best that I could so that when I look back I don't regret not doing enough. I really believe that you should not focus on what you could have done better, but focus on what you can do better, so that's pretty much what kept me moving forward."The 17-year-old from Mthatha said one of the biggest challenges was a lack of computers at her school. This forced pupils to use internet cafes if they wanted to research."So it was really difficult for us to do our assignments because we did not have the necessary resources," she said.She said being named as one of the top achievers in the country was "exciting and a very humbling experience".Hlalukana is going to study applied mathematics at University of Pretoria.
