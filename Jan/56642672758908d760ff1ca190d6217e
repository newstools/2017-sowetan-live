Ajax Cape Town midfielder Lebohang Mokoena says he's not in the Mother City for a "holiday" and will keep fighting for his place in the team.Many will recall that "Cheeseboy" made it clear that he left Mamelodi Sundowns last June because he was fed up with being a bench warmer. He then moved to Ajax on a two-year contract late in August.Mokoena, though, finds himself in exactly the same situation at Ajax, for whom he has played just three Absa Premiership games this season."It's been up and down. I mean, I came down because coach Roger [de Sa] needed me, so after his departure everything started from scratch."Coach [Stanley] Menzo had to take over, so I have to try and make sure I raise my hand," said the former Orlando Pirates winger.The 30-year-old admitted that it has been frustrating watching from the sidelines but remains confident of becoming a regular at Ajax."I think I've outgrown that [frustration] and I'm still level-headed. It has taken time to adjust to the environment, understand the players and how the team operates."But I've only been with the club for four or five months. It is early days and I'm getting there," said Mokoena, who has also played two matches for the Ajax juniors in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge."Coach Menzo expects leadership and experience from me, so he's been really pushing me hard."I never had pre-season when I joined the club, but looking at the [current] break it's been a perfect opportunity for the technical team to load me and get me to my best," he said."I'm pushing myself with the MDC team and I've already played two games."
