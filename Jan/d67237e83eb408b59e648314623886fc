Bafana Bafana's absence at the Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon is an obvious sore point for some of us.But ensuring that they are in the next edition two years from now should be a priority.Sadly, it doesn't seem as though those who have the powers to make key decisions that would ensure we don't endure another month watching other teams compete at an international tournament, while wishing we were there, are bothered.As it is, our national team does not even have a coach, with Shakes Mashaba having been sacked and his assistants Owen da Gama and Thabo Senong clueless as to whether they will continue in their jobs.Yet despite Safa releasing a statement two weeks ago that the matter would receive priority, nothing of substance came out of the "technical committee meeting" held at the weekend. Chairperson Natasha Tsichlas reported the committee could not discuss anything as Safa president Danny Jordaan was still at the Nations Cup.Which is all the more puzzling because it was Safa who had told us Jordaan would return specifically for this meeting at the weekend, which now turns out to have been futile."[Jordaan] is currently on CAF duty in Gabon as a member of the Afcon Organising Committee and will return to South Africa to address the coaching matter with the CEO and the Safa Technical Committee next week [January 21]," Safa said in a January 11 statement.The association has not told us why Jordaan is still stuck in Gabon.Perhaps the coach he has identified is still involved in the tournament, hence the need to stay on a few more days and close the deal.But whatever the case, time is moving fast. As the saying goes, it waits for no man.In a matter of nine or so weeks, Bafana should be back on the field, playing their first match under the new coach - if Mashaba doesn't win his CCMA case and gets reinstated as per his demand - when the first of the Fifa international weeks kicks in from March 22-28.After that, Bafana face a tough trip to Nigeria as they open their qualification campaign for the next continental finals in Cameroon in 2019. That match is scheduled for the next Fifa week of June 5-13.In August, the World Cup dream, started by Mashaba last year, continues with crucial back-to-back matches against Cape Verde (August 28/29 and September 2/3).Such a terrifying schedule for the national team should be spurring Safa into action to resolve the position of the national coaching with a sense of urgency.But alas, it doesn't seem like anybody at Safa House has an idea of what this year holds.We thought by quitting politics, Jordaan would now be more hands-on and provide leadership - which was sorely lacking when he was "deployed" to Nelson Mandela Bay - at Safa. Instead, it appears he's seized the moment to do some globe-trotting."The president of the association visited Zurich, Switzerland to attend the inaugural Fifa Best Awards," Safa said in its statement a fortnight ago. Now he's in Gabon and has skipped a meeting that Safa had said he would attend.It's been a month since Mashaba was sacked - on December 22 - and Safa's passivity in replacing him makes me wonder why it had to spoil his Christmas in the first place when such a crucial year awaits.
