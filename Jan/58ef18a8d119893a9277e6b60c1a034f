Giovanni Solinas says he has not been contacted by Orlando Pirates to take over the head coaching position at the Soweto giants, while admitting that coaching the Bucs would be "a dream".Solinas and Free State Stars "mutually agreed" to terminate the coach's contract at the 14th-placed Premier Soccer League team on Wednesday.Given that there was speculation about the Italian joining Pirates ahead of 2016-17 after his first and more successful stint at Stars last season, Solinas has again been linked to the Buccaneers.Pirates' development head Augusto Palacios has served as caretaker-coach since the departure of Muhsin Ertugral in early November, and Bucs are hovering at 10th place during the six-week PSL break."At the moment I have not had contact from Pirates," Solinas said. "But Pirates is a big club."It's one of the best clubs not only in South Africa but on the African continent. So everyone wants to coach Pirates. To coach Pirates is a privilege and an honour."Coaching Stars, who play in front of a few hundred fans at their Bethlehem base, and one of Southern Africa's biggest teams are two entirely different prospects in terms of pressure. "But pressure - we need to accept pressure in football," Solinas said."Do you think at Real Madrid you don't have pressure? It's normal. It's not a problem."Asked if he would be interested in an offer from Bucs, Solinas replied: "For me it's a dream. It would be unbelievable - fantastic."Solinas has experience coaching at big clubs, notably ES Setif in Algeria. "Setif is the same as Pirates in Algeria. They have the same colours - black and white."They are the Juventus of Algeria. And they also have a lot of fans - 20 000 or 25 000 in the stadium every game."I had a lot of pressure there. But it was a good club with good players. Pressure is not a problem. The problem in football is when you don't have good players." - TMG Digital
