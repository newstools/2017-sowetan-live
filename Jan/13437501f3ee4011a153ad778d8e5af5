Nigerian and other West African countries are preparing a joint force to intervene militarily in Gambia if President Yahya Jammeh does not hand over power, a Nigerian military source said on Tuesday. A decision has been taken that he will not remain president of Gambia at the expiration of his tenure, the source said, referring to Jammeh. Jammeh lost a Dec. 1 vote to president-elect Adama Barrow who is due to be sworn in on Thursday. Jammeh conceded defeat but now says he will not step down.
