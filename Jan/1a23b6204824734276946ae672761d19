French club Montpellier have increased their offer for Keagan Dolly to 1,7-million Euros and hope to have the deal sorted in the next 24 hours, one of the agents involved in negotiations said. It is almost sorted. I m sure they will get him. They have lifted their fee, Bruno Satin told Times Lives in Libreville on Wednesday. I reckon it could be done by the end of the day. They really want him. Satin said the club had been following Dolly since the African Under-23 Championship in Senegal in late 2015.He also suggested Rivaldo Coetzee could be the next South African international to head off, saying the Ajax Cape Town centre-back had also been recommended to clubs in Europe.The French agent, who took Sergio Aguero to Manchester City and handled Gerard Pique s deals, is also the manager of several top African talent.He is in Gabon with Senegal centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly, who plays for Naples and has an alleged price tag of 50-milion Euros on his head.Should Montpellier get Dolly it will end a protracted, and controversial, transfer saga centred around the release clause in the 23-year-old s contract, which now has been met by the Ligue 1 club.Should Dolly move to France he will join Kermit Erasmus (Rennes) and Lebo Mothiba (Lille) in a league that is regarded as among the top five in Europe.Dolly was a R7.5-million signing for Sundowns from Ajax Cape Town in 2014 and was immediately loaned back to the Mother City side for that season.He arrived at Chloorkop at the start of last season and became an instant regular and an important player in the pursuit of the African Champions League title.The Westbury-born playmaker one a single international cap in 2014, but was recalled to the side in June for the away Nations Cup qualifier in Gambia and scored two fantastic goals.He has retained his place since and will hope that a potential move to France further enhances his credentials for the incoming Bafana Bafana coach. - TMG Digital
