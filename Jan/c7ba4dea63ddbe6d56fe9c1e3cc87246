A resurgent Rafael Nadal beat Milos Raonic to reach his first Grand Slam semi in three years at the Australian Open yesterday as Serena Williams eyed a final with her sister Venus.Nadal hasn't contested a major semifinal since he won the last of his 14 Grand Slam titles at the 2014 French Open, but he never looked like losing to Raonic, the Canadian world number three.Spain's Nadal yelled in delight as he completed a 6-4, 7-6 (9/7), 6-4 win which set up a semifinal with Grigor Dimitrov - with old rival Roger Federer potentially waiting in the final."Even though I had a great career, I had a lot of tough moments," said Nadal, who struggled with injury last year and failed to reach any of the Grand Slam quarterfinals."That makes me enjoy this even more."Federer will play fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka in today's semifinal, with the very real prospect of a ninth Grand Slam final against Nadal.The women's competition also has a retro feel after Serena beat Britain's Johanna Konta 6-2, 6-3 to set up a semifinal with Mirjana Lucic-Baroni - 19 years after they last met.Serena, whose sister Venus plays Coco Vandeweghe in today's other semifinal, said she could take inspiration from Lucic-Baroni."I'm really happy for Mirjana. I was there when she first started. It's a wonderful story."
