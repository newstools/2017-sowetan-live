African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) leader Collen Maine says their choice of the presidential candidate will send 'shockwaves' throughout the ruling party.This comes as different members and structures of the ANC are making public their preferred choices of candidates in the succession race.The ruling party is gearing up for its 54th National Conference in which Jacob Zuma's successor will get elected. The conference is set to take place in December.Maine's comments suggest that the Youth League will not be backing the obvious leaders that have been put forward.So far, the race to replace Zuma has been between outgoing Africa Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and recently ANC treasurer general Zweli Mkhize's name has also been thrown in the hat. These candidates who have been mentioned are part of the system. They have been part of the system we want to change. We need bold leadership. We need a second revolution that will cause ruptures in the economy, Maine told Reuters.According to Maine, the ANC leaders have failed in transforming South Africa.The ANC leadership has been grappling to contain the succession debate which has laid bare divisions and different factions in the ruling party.Secretary general Gwede Mantashe urged ANC members to stop throwing names into the leadership race.This came after trade union Cosatu and the ANC Women's League made public their preferred candidate.Cosatu said they were backing Ramaphosa while the Women's League backed Dlamini-Zuma.The question now is, who's the 'shockwave' the Youth League will back for the ANC top position?The Youth League could opt to go for a younger leadership. The Mail &amp; Guardian reported ahead of ANC NEC meeting last year that the 'Young Lions' in the ANC have been tipped to take over leadership in the ruling party.Malusi Gigaba and Fikile Mbalula's names topped the list of the so-called 'Young Lions'.The paper reported then, the disdain with the current leadership following the party's poor performance in the local government elections and that the talk for change of leadership was imminent.It also reported on two factions in the ANC: One is rooting for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as the next president, with Gigaba as her deputy and Mbalula as secretary general replacing Gwede Mantashe.The other faction is the famous 'premier league' which consists of President Jacob Zuma's supporters, Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza, North West premier Supra Mahumapelo and Free State premier Ace Magashule. This faction is rooting for Mabuza as deputy president and Magashule as ANC chairperson.Mbalula however told Sowetan LIVE in August during the Rio Olympics that he could not comment on the reports. "I can't speak about that, I'm in Rio and I haven't seen the report," he said."Even if you explain explain to me, I don't know where they [reports] come from."
