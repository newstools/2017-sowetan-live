South Africa should seriously consider extending its R141-billion social security system by providing pregnancy grant to poor women.Researchers from Wits University, Burnet Institute, and Monash University in Australia, Ghent University in Belgium, and a Canadian independent consultant have recommended a pregnancy grant for South African women."To obtain maximum benefit, pregnant women would ideally initiate support as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed," write the researchers in last month's SA Medical Journal.According to the researchers, nutritional status during pregnancy is a key determinant of the woman's baby weight at birth, and thus of childhood survival and life chances, as well as having inter-generational effects.Figures released by Statistics SA in October revealed that in 2014, perinatal deaths declined by 3.6% from 22 274 in 2013.In 2014, about two-thirds (65.8%) of perinatal deaths were stillbirths and the remaining one-third early neonatal deaths (newborns in the first month - 34.2%).The World Health Organisation describes perinatal mortality as the number of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life per 1000 total births. The perinatal period commences at 22 completed weeks of pregnancy and ends seven completed days after birth.The researchers, who include professors Matthew Chersich, Stanley Luchters, Sharon Fonn, Helen Rees, Alex van den Heever, and Dr Duane Blaauw, Dr Fiona Scorgie and Dr Elizabeth Peach, say starting support in pregnancy would mean that the critical neonatal period would be covered.The researchers say a pregnancy grant would be paid in cash only as soon as a woman's pregnancy is confirmed. They believe that the earlier the support, the more optimal placental transfer of nutrients will be, with benefits for both child and mother.They said the absence of a pregnancy grant in SA is a serious flaw and such a grant is long overdue.Nearly 30 countries across the world, including eight on the continent, already provide pregnancy grants in cash or vouchers, varying from R14 in Mozambique to about R3500 in Bolivia, where women receive it until the child is two years old.But DA MP Lungiswa James, who sits in the National Assembly's portfolio committee on health, said pregnant women and their unborn children were well-looked after. "I don't think it's a good idea [to offer pregnancy grants]."James said health education should be prioritised and women empowered with knowledge to make responsible decisions.Health Department spokesman Joe Maila referred queries to his social development counterpart Lumka Oliphant, who was not available.
