Western Cape traffic cops gifted thousands of motorists with close to R30-million in fines this festive season.This was revealed by the Transport and Public Works portfolio committee which presented a report to the Western Cape legislature on Tuesday. According to the report the number of road fatalities dropped from 208 to 199. In addition officers arrested 383 people and issued fines of more than R28.9-million between December 1 last year and January 16.Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said their officers had to work extra hard due to the high number of veld fires. He said some roads had to be closed for two days due to heavy smoke and the department had to deploy officers to affected areas. Fires over the festive seasons resulted in extended working hours for traffic officers in road closures and temporary detours to ensure traffic flow said Africa.More than 19 towns including the City of Cape Town metro area were impacted by these road closures. It was dangerous out there but our traffic officers worked around the clock to ensure motorists are safe he said.The report also states that traffic officers nabbed motorists for transporting drugs and abalone worth more than R2.2-million in six towns.Politicians including Transport and Public Works MEC Donald Grant commended the province s officers for their work. Well done on a good plan. Whilst one welcomes the reduction on the number of fatalities one always wishes that it can be more said Grant.
