"Our Father who art in Heaven . Ke gathetse ke di phoso tse ke di entseng [I'm tired of the mistakes I've made] . Dikeledi tsaka di rotha ke lle chankaneng [my tears are rolling down my face in prison]."Ke ikentse mathateng Wantsa seretseng [I got myself into trouble and You took me out of it]. My life was too fast, five to, ho ya di heleng [I was close to going to hell] ."These are the words of hip-hop muso Molemo "Jub Jub" Maarohanye in his new song Ke Kopa Tshwarelo, in collaboration with musician Tshepo Tshola. The song was posted on YouTube a few hours after Maarohanye and Themba Tshabalala were released on parole yesterday. The two were serving time for the deaths of four Protea Glen, Soweto, pupils. They were drag racing and crashed into a group, killing four and wounding two others.". Standing before you . all I need from you is guidance. Ngiwayenzile ama [I have done] careless [things], sniffing coke [cocaine], riding reckless. Thought I was doing best, living life to the fullest .," the song continues."I'm grateful for the second chance. Now I know where my life stands, with a purpose. I just wanna tie up all the loose ends. No more wrong turns ."Tshola comes in in the chorus and says Maarohanye has asked for forgiveness.In the nearly five-minute song, Tshola also asks people to open their hearts and accept the apology.Maarohanye also apologises to his mother Jackie, wife and brothers.Social media was abuzz with comments on the song. Some accept the apology and look forward to Maarohanye making more music.
