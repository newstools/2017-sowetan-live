Reports in Denmark suggest Brondby are ready to pull the plug on contract negotiations with South African midfielder Lebogang Phiri but the player says he is still hopeful a deal can be reached.The two parties have been in dialogue for six months over an extension of his current deal which expires in June yet there appears to be no common ground.And Brondby have now suggested they may have to move on and start thinking about life after the 22-year-old."Time is ticking and with regards to finding replacements we cannot wait all that long Brondby sports director Troels Bech told BT. We have reached a stalemate and it is only right that we start to look at alternatives otherwise we have not fulfilled our responsibilities. Phiri is free to sign a pre-contract with another club for next season but so far has not entered into negotiations with anyone.He remains hopeful that a deal can be struck and says his heart remains with Brondby. I have been in contact with the club for quite some time [over a new contract] Phiri admits to 3point.dk. It has been a long dialogue and we have not reached an agreement yet. I have done a lot for the club and the club has done a lot for me."I'm still focused on developing myself so if all goes well I am here also the next four years. But if not I have to accept the situation and move on."My heart will always be in Brondby for it was the club that gave me the platform and the coach [Alexander Zorniger] has much faith in me. He gives me the courage to do more than is expected [of me]. Phiri joined Brondby in January 2013 from the BidVest Wits academy initially on an amateur contract but was quickly elevated to the first team and months later played a big role in helping the side avoid relegation.He has been a leading players for the side since and a key cog in their midfield making over 100 starts in all competitions including the UEFA Europa League.Phiri made his debut for Bafana Bafana in a 3-1 friendly win over Swaziland in March 2015 and also played all three games as the side won the COSAFA Castle Cup in Namibia last June. - TMG Digital
