South Africa will learn their fate in the qualifiers for the 2019 African Nations Cup finals when the draw for the preliminaries is held in Libreville Gabon this evening.The qualifiers for the finals in Cameroon are scheduled to start in the FIFA calendar date from March 20-28 a little over a month after the completion of the 2017 finals in Gabon on February 5.That would present a first real challenge for the newly-installed Bafana Bafana coach who is yet to be named as the process to select a replacement for the sacked Shakes Mashaba is on-going.The Confederation of African Football confirmed that the draw would take place at 20h30 South African time but did not reveal the format.It is thought they will stick with the method used for the 2017 finals which saw the 52 entrants split into 13 groups with the top side in each pool advancing to the finals along with the two best runners-up and the hosts Cameroon.Bafana have only been successful in a Nations Cup qualification campaign in one of the previous five tournaments when Mashaba took them to the 2015 finals.They played in the 2013 tournament as hosts. - TMG Digital
