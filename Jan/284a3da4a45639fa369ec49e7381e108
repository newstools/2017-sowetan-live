Kennedy Mweene's crystal ball has told him that the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Gabon will be a tournament for dark horses to surprise the big guns.Mweene's prediction comes as no surprise because few had given his Zambia a chance of winning the competition in 2012, upsetting overwhelming favourites Ivory Coast to clinch their first ever continental title via a penalty shootout.The big guns - Ivory Coast, Ghana, Senegal and Egypt - are again some of the favourites to win the competition which kicks off tomorrow in Libreville. But Mweene fancies the so called smaller teams to conquer."I put my money on Zimbabwe and Uganda. Those teams will give people a surprise."I am not saying this because my [Mamelodi Sundowns] teammates are in those teams. It's because I have played against these countries and I have seen how they have grown. Zimbabwe drew with Cameroon [in friendly this week], which tells you a lot. Uganda have very good players. I know if they work together as a team, they can do well. The're no small teams. It's not about names anymore. Things have changed."Mweene has backed his Sundowns teammates, Khama Billiat and Denis Onyango, to have the same impact for their countries as they did in their club's CAF Champions League fairytale story last year."They will add a lot of value and positive energy. They know how to win, they know Africa and the conditions. I know for a fact Onyango will make a mark. Once he does, Uganda will go far."Mweene's former coach Herve Renard will go into the tournament in search of a third title - this time with Morocco. But Mweene does not think the Frenchman will succeed."With us he spent about three years, which gave him time to know our strengths and weaknesses. He has not been with Morocco for a year. They have been doing well, but I don't think he will do it this time round."
