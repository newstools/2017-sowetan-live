Mamelodi Sundowns boss Patrice Motsepe says he would like to see Pitso Mosimane emulate former Manchester United coach Alex Ferguson by staying at the club for decades.Ferguson was in charge of the English club for nearly three decades from 1986 to 2013.Mosimane, who has been with Sundowns since December 2012, is now on a new four-year deal as confirmed by the club yesterday."I would like Pitso to be the next Alex Ferguson or maybe even (Arsenal coach) Arsene Wenger," said Motsepe."If we are not going to develop South African talent, whose duty is it to develop? That's why I gave him a (new) four-year contract."Some months ago it appeared the club got ahead of themselves when confirming Mosimane was on a new contract, but the coach later told Sowetan in mid-November that he had not put pen to paper following a deadlock on certain clauses.Motsepe, though, explained that the reports didn't worry him and hinted at a strong relationship with Mosimane."I'm part of the old school of thought. When I shake your hand, it is done... I had already called him and asked, 'how is it going?' and he would say, 'Mr President, I'm very, very happy'. For me it was done, so when I read (that Pitso hadn't signed) I wasn't worried about that."Remember I was a lawyer in my previous life and if you are going to run a relationship based on contracts and of course contracts are important, but what is so much important is the mutual trust and commitment." He added Mosimane could go if Bafana wanted him.
