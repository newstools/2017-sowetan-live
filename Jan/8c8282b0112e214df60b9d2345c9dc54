Former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Enocent Mkhabela has joined Platinum Stars on loan until the end of the season.Mkhabela is the fourth player to join Dikwena in this transfer window following the signings of defender Willem Mwedihanga and midfielders Abia Nale and Gerald Phiri. We are proud to say that we have managed to get Mkhabela on a loan deal from Kaizer Chiefs " said Stars general manager Senzo Mazingiza."We are hopeful that he will help us in the middle of the park."Mkhabela s signing brings balance to the team and moreover he has worked with coach Cavin Johnson in the past. Mkhabela 27 made his PSL debut with Stars in 2011 before he moved to SuperSport United.He was one of eight new players paraded by Chiefs in June last year but after an unsuccessful spell with AmaKhosi he is on the move again.Mkhabela who trained with his team on Wednesday is versatile as he can operate as a midfielder and in defence. We were looking at signing three players but we have managed to get four which is fantastic for us."We have managed to support the coach in this regard to sign players he wanted."Even though we had challenges with the budget we have managed to move things around and make signings and we are proud to have achieved that."Mkhabela is with us now and this is the last of our signings for now but you never know."If Cristiano Ronaldo comes and we are able to sign him we will definitely do that added Mazingiza jokingly.Dikwena s first league match after the resumption of the Absa Premiership campaign is a tough clash against Orlando Pirates at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace on 8 February. - TMG Digital
