Measures include possible arrests and suspension of officials allegedly implicated in fraud and corruption related activities Vadi s office said said. The departmental investigating team has for some time been working closely with the Hawks and other law enforcement agencies to root out corruption at the centres. Earlier this week it emerged that the City of Johannesburg had suspended more than 70 officials.Of these Mashaba said: We have also acted swiftly in ensuring that 72 of the allegedly corrupt licensing centre officials are suspended from their jobs. All 72 officials were given an opportunity to provide reasons as to why they should not be suspended however their reasons were found to be unsatisfactory. We hope to conduct the disciplinary hearings as soon as possible. Due legal process will be followed at all times. He also asked residents for patience while we continue to rid our licensing centres of corrupt officials . We have hired an additional 40 new staff members and staff members from other sections within the licensing department will be deployed to vacant positions so as to minimise the effect on operations at the centres.
