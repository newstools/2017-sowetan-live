Kagiso Rabada ended a stubborn Sri Lankan opening partnership when he bowled Kaushal Silva on the second day of the second Test at Newlands yesterday.Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne defied South Africa's new ball attack for 73 minutes, putting on 31 runs before Rabada made the breakthrough in the 16th over when Silva was forced on to the back foot by a lifting delivery which he played on to his stumps.Sri Lanka lost a second wicket when Kusal Mendis, who had earlier slog-swept left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj for six, tried to repeat the shot and top-edged a simple catch to JP Duminy at short cover.Both Silva and Mendis were dismissed for 11.Quinton de Kock made his third Test century, and fast bowler Lahiru Kumara took six wickets before the SA innings ended when Kumara took his sixth wicket with the last ball before lunch.Kumara, 19, who had not taken more than two wickets in an innings in his previous two Test matches and three other first-class games, finished with 6/122.De Kock took his score from 68 to 101, made off 124 balls with 11 fours, before edging Kumara to wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal.Vernon Philander and Keshav Maharaj put on 40 for the ninth wicket before Philander became Kumara's fifth victim, edging a drive to Chandimal.Chandimal earlier caught night watchman Kyle Abbott off the bowling of left-arm spinner Rangana Herath.Chandimal did not keep wicket on the first day because of a fever, although he fielded.
