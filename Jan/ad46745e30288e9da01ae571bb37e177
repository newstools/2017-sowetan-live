French club Toulouse announced on Wednesday they have signed Stormers fullback Cheslin Kolbe.The hot-stepping Kolbe who is cousin to Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk will join the French club at the conclusion of the 2017 Super Rugby season. Kolbe 23 also became an Olympian in 2016 winning a bronze medal with the Blitzboks at the Rio Games. I spotted this unusual player in South African rugby at the Under-20 World Cup held in France and during which Cheslin blitzed many opponents said Toulouse sporting director Fabien Pelous. Since then with his experience in Super Rugby he will be complementing our team as a finisher from deep and out wide. Undoubtedly his qualities of speed his stepping his excellent kicking and his ability to contest in the air will be assets in the game of movement that we practice. Earlier this week 25-year-old Bulls and Springbok flank Arno Botha signed for Irish province Ulster as the exodus of young SA players gathers speed. - TMG Digital
