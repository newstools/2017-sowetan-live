Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams launched their Australian Open campaigns in style yesterday as Ivo Karlovic smashed a record 75 aces in an unprecedented, 84-game marathon.Djokovic and Williams have both dropped to world number two and faced awkward opposition, but they won in straight sets against Fernando Verdasco and Belinda Bencic respectively.Rafael Nadal also rolled into round two before Karlovic outlasted Horacio Zeballos in an epic that stretched for five hours, 15 minutes and ended 6-7 (6/8), 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 22-20.Karlovic beat Thomas Johansson's Australian Open record of 51 aces in a match, set in 2005, and 84 games was a new mark for the tournament in the tiebreak era. "This is what I will, after my career, remember. If it was easy match or I lost easy, I wouldn't remember. But this one definitely I will remember forever," said the Croatian.Djokovic gave further evidence of his return to form as he convincingly saw off Verdasco 6-1, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 .Djokovic fell off the top of the rankings after a sudden slump last year but he showed signs of a revival by beating new world number one Andy Murray in this month's Doha final.It was Djokovic's 15th straight win at the Australian Open as he seeks his third straight title and his seventh overall, which would break Roy Emerson's record set in the 1960s. "I'm very pleased with the first round, considering I had one of the toughest first-round draws, definitely considering his form, how well he played against me in Doha," he said.In afternoon play, Williams and Nadal made light of hot temperatures and doubts over their own form as they got off to sizzling starts. Williams demolished the dangerous Bencic 6-4, 6-3, while Nadal was also impressive in his 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Florian Mayer. Williams can break Steffi Graf's Open-era record of 22 Grand Slam titles if she wins in Melbourne.
