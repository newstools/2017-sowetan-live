Lehlohonolo Masalesa's move to Greece has made him believe that doors to new opportunities do not close forever.It looked as though the 24-year-old central midfielder's career was going backwards after leaving Orlando Pirates, when he realised his dream of moving to Europe.Now the lanky midfielder is hoping the move to Greece, where he plays for Athlitiki Enosi Larissa (AEL) FC, will open doors to a regular spot with Bafana Bafana."I hope if I play regularly at club level it will help my chances of playing for the national team because we all dream of playing for our country. I may have played for the junior national teams, but as a player you want to play for the senior team," he said.Masalesa has watched how the likes of Andile Jali and Thulani Serero have improved their game while playing in Europe and he's encouraged by the impact these players usually make for Bafana Bafana.Serero was instrumental in Bafana's victory over Senegal in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, while Jali is playing with a lot more guts and guile since moving to Europe."The level of football in Europe is high. I watch guys like Jali and Serero and see how they are improving. Look how well they did against a big te am like Senegal," said Masalesa."What I like about the environment [in Larissa] is that you can fully focus on football. The technical team is always willing to stay with you after training to help you improve your game. So this will help me."As he progresses in Europe, Masalesa would love to see himself playing Uefa Champions League football, which he grew up watching on TV."Hopefully it will happen because I grew up watching [Zinedine] Zidane, Edgar Davids in the Champions League. I think the Champions League is tougher than the World Cup, so hopefully I can get to play in it."Even though he is not having any trouble settling in, Masalesa would love to have his girlfriend and daughter join him in Greece. He is living in a hotel, but will get a place of his own.
