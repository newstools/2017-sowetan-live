The controversial Fica Bill which was sent back to Parliament by the President citing constitutional concerns would pass Constitutional muster the Finance committee has heard.The Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill written to combat corruption white collar crime and money laundering by placing greater scrutiny on the financial affairs of prominent individuals was sent back to Parliament last year because President Jacob Zuma believes that a clause allowing for warrant-less searches of premises is unconstitutional because it limits the right to privacy.Public hearings are currently underway in Parliament to deal with the President s concerns.The Bill has been vehemently opposed by the Black Business Council (BBC)and its policy head Mzwanele Manyi.The BBC claims that there are other constitutional issues around the Bill and want these opened up too.They will be making submissions to Parliament later today.Parliament s legal advisor Frank Jenkins told the committee that the hearings could according to the rules of Parliament only focus on the exact issues for which the President sent it back.The BBC however wrote to Parliament in December stating they believed all aspects of the Bill s constitutionality should be opened up for discussion.However in a written response chairman of the finance committee Yunus Carrim said the Bill was gazetted for public comment but the Treasury had indicated that they received no submissions from the Black Business Council.He also pointed out that the BBC had not participated in the parliamentary public hearings into the Bill held in 2015 and 2016. I understand that your organisation believes other provisions of the Bill are unconstitutional.Unfortunately the committee cannot in terms of this process focus on the constitutionality of other provisions of the Fica Bill he wrote.Advocate Ishmael Semenya providing legal opinion for the Speaker of the National Assembly said he believed that the Bill as it currently stands would survive constitutional scrutiny and pass muster .Semenya told the committee that the Constitutional Court in five cases had not ruled that searches could not be conducted without a warrant but that these had to be the exception to the rule and there had to be justification for such a search to be conducted.Advocate Jeremy Gauntlett presenting legal opinion on behalf of the National Treasury said all the legal views were independent but showed some commonality .He said his advice was much the same as that presented by Semenya although a little more conservative .Gauntlett suggested that minor adjustments be specifically built in to the Bill to limit the harm caused by such a search to avoid legal combustion .
