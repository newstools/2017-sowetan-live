 What is revolutionary about being led by a person in old age? That s the question Zimbabwean ruling ZANU-PF and its youth wing must ask itself the EFF s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said on Tuesday.They must also ask themselves what is revolutionary and being led by a leader who sleeps all the time in meetings can no longer even hold a pen or write half a page Ndlozi said of President Robert Mugabe.This was in response to the ZANU-PF spokesman Psychology Maziwisa s dismissal of EFF leader Julius Malema s scathing comments on Monday in which he called on Grandpa Mugabe to step down. PAC defends Mugabe from Malema Maziwisa said: Not bothered at all by Julius Malema s latest ranting. He is a little and irrelevant man who is trying desperately to gain political mileage in South Africa by insulting a great man in Zimbabwe. Won t win! Maziwisa reportedly posted on Facebook.Ndlozi shot back that both the the ZANU-PF and its youth wing are cowards and added that they are afraid of President Mugabe . Malema tells Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe to go and enjoys another anti-white rant He was particularly scathing of the youth wing saying it is defending and advancing an essentially anti-youth statuesque . This is because there is actually no youth in the ZANU-PF Youth; what you find are middle age men and women half of which are suffering from a mid-life crises. They should be ashamed of themselves for holding the future from being born in Zimbabwe. He reiterated Malema s stance and said the party reaffirms its position that President Mugabe s occupancy of the position of president is not good for the radical African political programme . He is the bastion of the reactionary phenomenon of lead to the death that has crippled the image and praxis of post-colonial Africa. President Mugabe is not only the contemporary engine of personality cult but he is protected by a group of cowards around him who hypocritically defend him everyday whilst harbouring ambitions to lead soon.
