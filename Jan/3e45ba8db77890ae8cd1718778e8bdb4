Paul Adams hold no grudges against anyone at the Cape Cobras following his controversial redeployment from head coach of the franchise to manager of the Western Cape Cricket High Performance set-up.In September last year 10 of the 17 contracted players filed a dispute with the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) regarding Adams position after a breakdown in relationship.The Western Cape Cricket board initially supported Adams with a vote of confidence motion.But late last month a joint statement confirmed that he had stepped down to be replaced by former Proteas batsman Ashwell Prince.Speaking for the first time since the move on Thursday the former Proteas slow left-arm chinaman said he had put the episode behind him and was fully focused on his new project of unearthing new talent for the franchise. I have taken responsibility that results were not as expected on the field in the last few months and I bear no grudges against anyone who had a problem with me " he said."I have moved on to a new and exciting role which is where my full attention is at the moment and I have no regrets with what happened. Being moved from head of the franchise to working with youngsters is seen as a demotion.But Adams said he was never obsessed with job titles and he was happy to have another opportunity to serve the game. I don t worry about titles serving cricket is what is important to me and I am happy that I have another opportunity to work with youngsters which is what I did before I was appointed as head coach five years ago."I have been involved in professional cricket for 21 years and I feel that I will continue to make a meaningful contribution working with the youngsters."While I was head coach we identified High Performance as an area where we must tighten up and this is what I would be doing from now on and it excites me. He also said he would be open to considering other head coaching positions in the future but it is unlikely that a job is available in South Africa at the moment as all the franchises seem to be settled.In his five seasons at the Cobras Adams oversaw the progression of players like Beuran Hendricks Dane Piedt Dane Paterson and George Linde to the senior side.He recently helped Wayne Parnell to return to the Proteas after a number of injury setbacks.Adams is also the youngest South African Test player after he was capped aged 18 years and 340 days.He is among the highest qualified coaches in South Africa with a level 4 qualification and he helped the Cobras to five trophies in as many years in charge. - TMG Digital
