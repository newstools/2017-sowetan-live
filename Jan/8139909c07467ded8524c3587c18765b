Proteas all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo is fully aware that he is in the current T20 side to take on Sri Lanka in the three match series largely because some of the senior players have been rested.The first match takes placed in Centurion on Friday afternoon and the 2014 Under-19 World Cup winner is determined to make the most of the opportunity. I want to have a good impact in the game if I get the opportunity to play and hopefully I will find myself in situations to win games for the team " he said this week as the Proteas stepped up their preparations for the opener at Centurion."The most important thing is to contribute in fielding batting and bowling remain positive and do anything to win games for South Africa. Phehlukwayo who has been capped six times by the ODI side also warned his team-mates to be businesslike as the Sri Lankans will come out fighting following the embarrassing 3-0 whitewash in the Test series. We are well aware that in white ball cricket the Sri Lankans are very good they are in pain and they are going to come with a good fighting spirit."So I think we need to be aware that they are going to come hard but we must stick to our game plan and execute our plans very well throughout the series. The team environment is very good and the guys are in a good space."There are a couple of guys who have come in and they have been really welcomed to the team and we have a good team culture."I personally feel part of the team again and I am willing to contribute and do well for the team. Wayne Parnell is the most senior fast bowler in the squad and he is expected to take the new ball.But Phehlukwayo said he would be up to the challenge if coach Russell Domingo and captain Farhaan Behardien decide to give him that responsibility. It is a challenge that I would like to take up because every challenge is good."It was a situation that I was put in by the Dolphins so I would like to take it up and do my best."We have spoken about how we are going to approach the Sri Lankans because we must have a good mindset look to hit them hard up front by getting bouncers and stuff like that."Phehlukwayo missed a big chunk of the CSA T20 Challenge that was won by the Titans in December due to injuries but he has since recovered and raring to go. It was really unfortunate that I got injured at that time because l was excited about the T20 domestic campaign."I would have liked to contribute at the Dolphins in that competition and boost my confidence but it was not to be."I have worked hard to get back to full fitness I have played a few four-day games and I am feeling good."The injury was a positive as much as it was a negative. - TMG Digital
