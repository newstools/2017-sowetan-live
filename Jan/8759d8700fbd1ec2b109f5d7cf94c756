Dino Ndlovu scored his eighth goal of the season in 16 starts to continue his fine form for title-chasing Azerbaijan side Qarabag as he returned to action following the winter break in that country.Ndlovu slotted home a penalty for his team to seal a point that keeps them top of the league a point ahead of second-placed Qabala.The 26-year-old will hope his form will not go unnoticed by the incoming Bafana Bafana coach having refused to play in the latter stages of ex-boss Ephraim Shakes Mashaba s tenure.If you include last season s spell with Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta Ndlovu has scored 26 goals in 42 starts in the last 18 months making him comfortably the most prolific South African striker playing home or abroad.Speaking of Bafana outcasts Kermit Erasmus made his debut for French Ligue 2 side Lens at the weekend but could not help them avoid a 2-1 defeat at Amiens.Erasmus who joined the club on loan from top-flight Rennes after finding his path to the first team blocked there was brought on in injury-time to try and grab an equaliser.Another player making his debut was defensive midfielder Zama Rambuwane who signed for Israeli second-tier side Ironi Nesher on loan from SuperSport United last week.Rambuwane had spent the first six months of the season at top-flight Hapoel Ra anana in Israel but made little impact.Tokelo Rantie started for Turkish side Genclerbirligi as they played to a disappointing 1-1 draw with Osmanlispor in a league clash.Another player banished from the national team he will hope his increased game-time in Turkey perhaps wins him a recall under the new technical team.The same can perhaps be said for midfielder Kamohelo Mokotjo who had vowed not to play under Mashaba but continues to be a beacon of consistency in the Netherlands where he helped his FC Twente side win 2-1 away at PEC Zwolle.Andile Jali made another start at Belgian side KV Oostende but they were thumped 3-0 by Sint Truiden while Ayanda patois continues to be frozen out at Lokeren and Lars Veldwijk did not make it off the bench for Kortrijk. Lehlogonolo Masalesa (Larissa Greece) and Bongani Zungu (Vitoria Guimaraes Portugal) both started for their respective sides but had to settle for draws.
