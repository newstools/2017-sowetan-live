Andile Jali will be given the opportunity to rekindle his career at Belgian top-flight side KV Oostende in the second half of the season, according to the club's coach Yves Vanderhaeghe.Jali made just a single appearance for the side in the first half of the season, having made clear his desire to leave in the last transfer window. He was also hampered by injuries but now having regained full fitness, Vanderhaeghe says it is like having a new signing for the team.And with club skipper S bastien Siani at the Africa Cup of Nations finals in Gabon with Cameroon, the coach says it has opened the door for Jali to make an immediate impact."The past six months were not enjoyable for him, but the stage is now set for a new start for Jali," Vanderhaeghe said."He has shown what he has up his sleeve and is again available for selection."He's a bit like a new signing for us and because we are missing Siani in his position, we might use Jali quite quickly," Vanderhaeghe said before last night's game against Gent. Oostende played Genk in the semifinals of the Belgian Cup, the club's first game of 2017. Oostende were at home in the first leg, with the return to be played on January 31.Zulte-Waregem and Eupen, who have the SA pair of Ntuthuko Radebe and Phakamani Mngadi on their books, contested the other semifinal.Jali's return to action will be good news for the incoming Bafana Bafana coach. He played for Bafana in their 2-1 world Cup qualifier victory over Senegal in November but looked woefully out of touch. - TMG Digital
