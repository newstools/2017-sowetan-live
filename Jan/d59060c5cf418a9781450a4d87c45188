Serena Williams suffered a shock second-round defeat at the Auckland Classic yesterday following her sister Venus's earlier withdrawal with an arm injury.Top-seeded Serena blamed the wind for a string of unforced errors in her first event after a four-month layoff as she was sent packing 6-4, 6-7 (7/3), 6-4 in a two-hour, 14-minute arm wrestle with world number 72 Madison Brengle."I'm trying to think of a word that's not obscene, but that's pretty much how I played," Serena said."I just couldn't get used to the wind. My opponent played in the exact same conditions so obviously she was used to it and her game was more suited to it, but it was just really annoying me for whatever reason."Second seed Venus decided to quit after suffering a sore right arm during her struggle to a 7-6 (7/2), 6-2 first-round victory over 18-year-old New Zealander Jade Lewis playing in her first WTA tournament.Serena, playing in her first tournament since losing in the semifinals of the US Open in September, was looking for a bold showing in Auckland, to prepare for the Australian Open. Brengle goes through to meet seventh seed Jelena Ostapenko in the quarterfinals while Venus's withdrawal gifted Japanese teenager Naomi Osaka a berth in the final eight where she will play eighth-seed Croatian Ana Konjuh.lIn the other two quarterfinals, Caroline Wozniacki, now the top-ranked player remaining, will meet Germany's Julia Goerges, and Barbora Strycova of Croatia plays American Lauren Davis.
