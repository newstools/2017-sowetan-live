Achievers Simpiwe "Chain Reaction" Konkco, Hekkie "Hexecutioner" Budler and Zolani "Last Born" Tete were not aware until contacted by Sowetan yesterday that their triumph inside the roped square last year have earned them recognition by The Ring Magazine.The publication - owned by boxing great Oscar de la Hoya's Golden Boy Enterprises - has its own championship belt in all 17 weight classes.The magazine has also perpetrated boxing scandals, helped make unknown fighters famous worldwide, and covered the sport's biggest events of all time.Simpiwe "V12" Vetyeka, of Mdantsane, also earned a top rating in the magazine's featherweight division through his achievements last year, but was unavailable for comment yesterday.The Ring rated Konkco eighth, while his stablemate at trainer Colin Nathan's HotBox Gym, Budler, earned the No 9 spot in the junior flyweight class. Tete, from the All Winners gym of Mlandeli Tengimfene in East London, is also ranked eighth."I was not aware of that ratings. That is good news. It is good music in my ears."Those are big ratings. It says I am being recognised by the whole world. I worked hard to be where I am last year," said Konkco, who hails from Mthatha.Budler, from Newlands in Johannesburg, said: "I did not know about that rating. I am happy. Hopefully I will work my way to the No 1 spot and fight for the title."Tete, who is rated No 8 in the bantamweight division said: "Wow! These are good news. That is an achievement. Chances of being rated by The Ring are scarce. I am highly motivated."But I want to go right to the top and fight for The Ring belt." Tete is trained by Loyiso Mtya and the boxer's father Zolile Tete.Konkcoi and Tete are contesting for Boxing SA's Fighter of 2016.
