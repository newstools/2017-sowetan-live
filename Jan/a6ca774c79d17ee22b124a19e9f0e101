Uganda coach Milutin Sredojevic is open to returning to work in South Africa in future.The former Orlando Pirates coach's contract with Uganda has more than a year still to run, but the Serbian-born mentor told Sowetan that he would not rule out leaving the Cranes for the "right project".Micho is said to have attracted interest from all over the continent after his heroics with the Ugandan Cranes, helping them qualify for the Afcon for the first time in 39 years."Personally, I am more than open [to return to SA], but as a professional I am still focused on my job with Uganda until the right time and the right project comes," Sredojevic told Sowetan from Gabon.The 47-year-old refused to comment further since he is still expected to guide Uganda in their bid to qualify for the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia."My business manager Ivica Stankovic would be the best person to talk to. He knows all about those things. I just do my job."Stankovic did not want to rule out the possibility of the coach returning to SA, where he helped the Buccaneers reach the semifinal of the CAF Champions League in 2006."Everything is possible at this stage. Nothing is closed. We will sit together and speak to Uganda to see the way forward," he said."There has been interest coming from South Africa before, but there is nothing concrete on the table. Also, a lot has been said in the media."Pirates, a club Micho has been linked with, are set to announce a new coach before the end of the month.Bucs, though, have not been the type of club to rehire coaches.To this day, Pirates supporters still call for the return of Ruud Krol and Kosta Papic, as they previously did with Viktor Bondarenko, but Bucs chairman Irvin Khoza has ignored these calls.Could they make an exception for Micho? Only time will tell.
