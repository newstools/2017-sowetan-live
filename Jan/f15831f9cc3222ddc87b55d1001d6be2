Former gangster Pascal Mazibuko pays tribute to the late kwaito kingpin, Mandoza, through a song, for rescuing him from a life of crime and drugs.Mandoza died last year after a long battle with cancer. Mazibuko, who is a skin cancer survivor himself, is set to release a song titled Mandoza uTshabalala next week, paying homage to the man who helped change his life.He first performed the track at Mandoza's funeral.The song, that will be part of a full album, will be released through the late singer's recording company, Nkalakatha Entertainment, and Straight 4rom Da Hood Records, a company they co-founded.According to Mazibuko, who is from Zola in Soweto, Mandoza's hometown, the song was composed in June last year when Mandoza's health started deteriorating."I wrote the song to encourage him to get better and to realise that he can still beat cancer. I performed the song in August for him and he loved it."Mazibuko said since he has moved to Port Elizabeth he has opened a beauty salon that hires ex-convicts and runs Straight 4rom Da Hood."I will forever thank Mandoza for helping me. Today, I am a husband and a father of two."He signed under Nkalakatha Records while the singer was alive, and he is the first artist to be released under the label.The singer said had it not been for the Nkalakatha star, he would still be committing to crime.For seven years he smoked drugs and committed all sorts of criminal acts in order to survive but he was a dancer and loved music before he got involved in the underworld.Mazibuko said meeting Mandoza was a turning point for him as the musician convinced him to clean up his act."He was the one who made me realise that I have talent and I needed to stop doing crime. When I moved to Port Elizabeth to start afresh, he used to come and check on me."bambalelep@sowetan.co.za
