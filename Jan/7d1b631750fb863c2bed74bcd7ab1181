Vitoria de Guimaraes midfielder Bongani Zungu is delighted after delivering a fine performance for the Portuguese outfit on Tuesday night in only his first start.Not only did the former Sundowns star score his first goal for Guimaraes which was an injury time equaliser against Pa os de Ferreira in a cup clash that ended 2-2 but he was also named Man of the Match.This was the first time Zungu was starting a match for Guimaraes since arriving in Portugal in July. He had come off the bench two times and after being in the line up he believes he is destined for great things."I'm happy and God is great man " Zungu told TMG Digital from Portugal."With more game time like this I should be able to do more and go further."I've been working so hard and the team provided a lot of medical attention (for a shin injury)."I'm fit and very focused on my career."The Dukuza-born midfielder arrived at the club carrying the injury that he sustained while playing for Mamelodi Sundowns against Maritzburg United early this year.The 24-year-old is in line to start against Portugal's powerhouse Benfica in a league clash on Saturday.Guimaraes who are placed fifth on the log after 15 matches will play hosts against the log leaders. - TMG Digital
