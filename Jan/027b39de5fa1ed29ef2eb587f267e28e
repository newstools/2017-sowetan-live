Allister Coetzee will stay on as Springbok coach a highly place source confirmed to Times Media on Wednesday afternoon but there could be a compromise.Coetzee who oversaw just four wins in 12 Tests in his first year in charge as Springbok coach has somehow survived the axe and will continue in his role as head coach in 2017. The source indicated that part of the compromise would be for Brendan Venter who was on Monday confirmed as part of the Italian coaching staff until 2019 to consult on a more permanent basis to the Springboks. How that situation will unfold given that the Italian Rugby Federation had just made the announcement remains unclear. Venter was unavailable for comment.Coetzee s position will come under review again after June s series against France. If the Boks lose it he will be axed. It s understood that SA Rugby wanted to hire Munster director of rugby Rassie Erasmus while they could still trigger his get out clause but Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula urged SA Rugby to retain Coetzee. SA Rugby have not yet made an official announcement on Coetzee s tenure following their review process.
