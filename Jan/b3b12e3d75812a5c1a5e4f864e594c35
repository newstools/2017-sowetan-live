Edison Nesengani Senior Secondary School defied all odds when it became the only school in the once-volatile area Vuwani, Limpopo, to produce a 100% pass rate in the matric class of 2016.The school, situated in Tshino village, is not among those that were burnt during the protests. It was closed during the rioting.The area lost at least three months of schooling due to the protests that were sparked by discontentment with the decision to incorporate Vuwani and surrounding villages into a new municipality formed with Malamulele and its surrounds.Edison Nesengani deputy principal, Maanda Ambani, attributed the school's achievement to closer working relations between parents, teachers and pupils."During the three-month-long protests, teachers could not come to school, but we are grateful for the cooperation we received from parents who made sure that their children attended lessons under those difficult conditions," said a proud Ambani yesterday.He further thanked the support they got from the provincial department of education. The school had 75 pupils in matric, all of whom passed, with 44 obtaining entry towards bachelors degrees.Madzanga Mudau was ecstatic when she went to collect her results at the school yesterday. She plans to pursue a career in bookkeeping, and hopes to be admitted at Tshwane University of Technology."I sacrificed a lot last year to ensure I passed. And I'm happy about my achievement and those of my fellow pupils and wish them well in their future endeavours," she said. The 18-year-old was accompanied by her mother, Ntsieni.According to Ambani, parents took turns to camp inside the school premises "day and night" to prevent it from getting torched during the protests. More than 30 schools were burnt in the area.Ambani said the school had a shortage of teachers, with only two teaching mathematics in grades eight to 12 between them.The school last produced a 100% matric pass rate in 2012.Limpopo education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe commended the Vhembe district for doing well despite being affected by violent protests.He pointed out that the Vhuronga 1 circuit - where Edison Nesengani Secondary is situated - came out tops with 81.2% despite the protests. The Vhuronga 2 and Hlanganani North circuits also performed above the 60% national norm despite the unrest.Mbwili Secondary received the award for being the top achieving school in the province. Two schools obtained a 0% pass rate."We were sad when learning and teaching in 73 of our primary and secondary schools in Vhembe were brought to a halt," Kgetjepe said."Today is testimony that our learners courageously battled all these odds and [wrote] their exams like others in the province."Additional reporting by Zoe Mahopo.
