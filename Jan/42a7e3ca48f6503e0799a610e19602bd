Socialite Uyanda Mbuli is fuming after a Joburg man used her name to launch a website.The businesswoman told Sowetan she was not aware of any website in her name until a friend notified her of the site, which is linked to her social media pages."It's disturbing that someone would communicate on someone else's behalf, making commitments and representing them without duly given authority. This is quite strange," she said.Mbuli has two websites in her name, one registered in the US by an unknown source and another registered by a Clement Mabunda from Johannesburg.www.uyandambuli.com is a business website dealing in dresses not produced by Mbuli's fashion line Diamond Face Couture. www.uyandambuli.co.za appears to be a personal site which has a profile of the businesswoman and in which her pictures are used extensively.Mbuli said she plans to take legal action against Mabunda. "I've alerted my lawyers and requested them to look into copyright infringement via my legal right to my name," she added.Mabunda told Sowetan that he had a legal right to use Mbuli's name for his website."If she had visited the website she will see that I made it a point of stating that it is an unofficial website," he said. "I could have used anyone's name - it is not against the law."Mabunda dared Mbuli to take legal action against him."I am a lawyer myself . I don't have anything against Uyanda. If you look at my website I would like to think it paints her well."Mabunda said he was willing to shut down the website if the businesswoman talks to him about it.madibogoj@sowetan.co.za
