In yet another innovation to offer more opportunities to domestic athletes to qualify for major competitions, Athletics SA (ASA) has added a new series to its calendar for this year.Dubbed the "Speed Series", the inaugural elite track and field meets will run across the country between next month and March.The event - which features track distances from 100m to 5000m plus field events - is a direct replacement of the Nite Series that ASA introduced last year."Unlike the Nite Series, the Speed Series defines our business especially given the mushrooming of the sprints, the jumps and mid-distance," ASA president Aleck Skhosana told Sowetan yesterday of the series that is set to take off in Durban on February 28.Bloemfontein will host the second leg on March 8, Potchefstroom the third leg on March 15, while Germiston will stage the final meeting on March 22.Skhosana said with or without sponsorship "we'll go ahead and do everything in our power to ensure that our athletes get an opportunity to prepare for major events".He confirmed that there would be incentives for podium finishers and record breakers at the four meetings, but the board would determine the prizes at its meeting this weekend."ASA cannot go to sleep and wait for sponsors. It won't just be medals [on offer] but we will incentivise the athletes like we did during the Nite Series. We proved that we can have lucrative and well-organised events," he said, in reference to last year's Nite Series that paid the champions R5000 and offered R25000 for a senior national record.In view of an international calender highlighted by the IAAF World Championships in London in August, Skhosana said he was hoping that the Speed Series would serve as a launching pad for SA's (junior, youth and senior) track and field hopefuls.In the past, local senior athletes had to go abroad to seek opportunities to qualify for major competitions.The Nite Series produced Olympic Games qualification times from the likes of Caster Semenya, Akani Simbine and Elroy Gelant. Simbine went on to set a new national record with his 9.96 seconds performance in Pretoria in March last year.
