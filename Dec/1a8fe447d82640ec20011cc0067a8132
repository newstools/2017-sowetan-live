The Hawks said the operation has been planned since April‚ with arrests taking place from Tuesday this week. "On Tuesday three traffic examiners aged 46‚ 49 and 55 respectively and three runners were arrested for allegedly soliciting bribes from potential applicants for learner’s and driving licences at the Nkowankowa testing centre. "Yesterday a further 12 were arrested for the various corruption activities. "Two other traffic officials who ran away on Tuesday handed themselves over to the investigating team yesterday."
