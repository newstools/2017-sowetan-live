Alastair Cook hit a double hundred to defy Australian attempts to wrap up England's first innings in the fourth Ashes in Melbourne on Thursday. The stoic opening left-hander reached 200 late on the third day, rebounding from a lean scoring series in the opening three Tests. It was Cook's fifth double hundred in 151 Tests with his highest score of 294 coming against India in Birmingham in 2011.
