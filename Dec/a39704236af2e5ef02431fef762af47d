A magistrate who presided over an attempted rape case against a Seshego, Limpopo, teacher was taken aback  by the mysterious circumstances surrounding the granting of bail to the accused. The teacher, 52, appeared before Magistrate Marc Rykenburg in the Seshego Magistrate's Court for the attempted rape of a 12-year-old pupil. Rykenburg said he could not see documents indicating how the teacher was granted bail and for how much. He postponed the case to February 13 in order to get all details. "I cannot proceed with the matter before I familiarise myself with the contents of the docket and the circumstances surrounding the manner in which the bail was granted," Rykenburg said. He ordered the teacher to adhere to conditions of his bail until his next appearance. Among the conditions was that he may not contact the victim "directly or indirectly".  The girl's mother said she was also in the dark about how the bail was granted to the teacher. The teacher allegedly sent the girl home on October 9 to make him tea. He is alleged to have followed her and upon entering the house, started fondling her. The Grade 7 pupil screamed and the teacher left the house. According to police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, the teacher was also being investigated on allegations that he had raped other minors.
