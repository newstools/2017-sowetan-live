Golden Arrows captain Trevor Mathiane is delighted to have secured a new long-term contract with the club. Mathiane, who joined Abafana Bes'thende in the 2013-14 season, saw his original contract expire on June 30. The two parties were still locked in negotiations at the beginning of this month, but finally agreed terms on a three-year contract. "I'm really happy to stay with Arrows because it was going to be disappointing to leave the team," Mathiane told Sowetan yesterday. Nicknamed "Roadblock" for his polished defensive skills, the 28-year-old was part of the group that helped the KZN club win promotion to the PSL two years ago. The player's agent, Jazzman Mahlakgane, admitted that negotiating the deal wasn't easy. "It was back and forth in terms of numbers, but we finally reached an agreement with the chairlady [Mato Madlala]," Mahlakgane said. "There were also other clubs interested in him, but he was pro-Arrows because he's been with the team since the NFD and he's happy there." Mathiane finished the season strongly with 14 starts in the last 15 league matches after a slow start to his season. Arrows chief executive Gordon Masondo was full of praise for Mathiane's attitude on and off the field. "He's done a sterling job for us since we were in the First Division ."
