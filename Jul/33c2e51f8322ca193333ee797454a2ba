A social media campaign to boycott the Carling Black Label Champion Cup between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates appears to have had very little impact after the pre-season exhibition match was sold out yesterday.Organisers announced tickets to the match were officially sold out 12 days ahead of the encounter at FNB Stadium on July 29.Carling Black Label brand director Samori Gambrah expressed his delight at the response from the public. "This is another milestone for us at Carling Black Label.""The Carling Black Label Champion Cup comes at the right time whereby fans are anxious to see their new signees in action and also witness their team's pre-season preparations."Fans of the two most popular SA sides voiced their frustration after the clubs once again finished the season with bare trophy cabinets last month.Fans still have an opportunity to influence the outcome of the day and the starting line-up.Consumers can do this by purchasing a Carling beer and dialling *120*660*, then enter their unique code found on the underside of the bottle cap and the # sign (with no spaces in between).Voting closes at midnight next Tuesday. - TimesLIVE
