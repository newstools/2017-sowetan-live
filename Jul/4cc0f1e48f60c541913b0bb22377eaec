A Limpopo medical doctor accused of dealing in illicit drugs including nyaope and dagga has been suspended by the provincial health department.Dr Mpho Lekalakala, 34, was released on R1000 bail yesterday in the Waterval Magistrate's Court near Elim in Makhado after police arrested him on Wednesday.Spokesman for police in the province Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Leka-lakala was allegedly found in possession of nine sachets of nyaope, a plastic bag filled with dagga, and two smoking pipes during his arrest.He was charged with dealing and possession of drugs.Ngoepe said police officers acted on a tip off.Lekalakala, who was doing his community service at the Elim Hospital, was apparently on leave at the time of his arrest.The Bethesda Rehabilitation Centre, an NGO which assists with fighting drug addiction in the area, is also situated on the same hospital grounds where Lekalakala works.Spokesman for the provincial department of health Thabiso Teffo yesterday said they would suspend Lekalakala with immediate effect. Teffo said they would also report the matter to the Health Professions Council of SA."While we respect the notion of innocent until proven guilty, we are equally disappointed and disturbed at the prospect of a medical doctor possibly helping in the illegal distribution of illicit drugs. Doctors have taken an oath to look after the well-being of our people," Teffo said.He said it was expected of doctors to uphold high moral standards, adding that the allegations against Lekalakala were bringing the profession into disrepute.Yesterday, secretary at the Bethesda Rehabilitation Centre Khuthadzo Ravhutendele said they would not comment on the case.However, Ravhutendele said they dealt with cases which were referred to them by the hospital, while some people came to seek help from the organisation on a voluntary basis.She said doctors would sometimes refer a patient who initially came to the hospital complaining of symptoms such as chest pains and it was discovered that they took drugs.Ravhutendele said drugs were easily accessible around Elim, with some people selling them to school kids.She said they fight the scourge in the area through their awareness campaigns in the community.Lekalakala is expected to make his next court appearance on August 1.
