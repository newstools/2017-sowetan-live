The arrival of Thamsanqa Sangweni at Orlando Pirates may signify the start of a new era, according to the club's former player Phumudzo Manenzhe. Sangweni joined Bucs from Chippa United this week.Manenzhe believes the signing of the 28-year-old midfielder will bring about positive changes to the Soweto giants who have finished two seasons without a trophy and failed to make it into the top eight for the first time in the PSL era."After two unsuccessful seasons I think players like him are capable of helping the club get back to where it belongs. He will bring quality and stability in the team," said Manenzhe at the Carling Cup media conference in Johannesburg yesterday.The retired striker refused to compare Sangweni to ex-Pirates holding midfielder Andile Jali, and his brother Siyabonga."He must not be compared to anybody. I cannot compare him to Jali because he must record his own history at the club. Every player, when he joins a new team, wants to build his own history. I am sure that he would also like to make his own name. We know that his brother [Siyabonga] also played for Pirates, but that does not mean anything," stated the 33-year-old.Sangweni was the captain at Chippa and Manenzhe hopes that his leadership skills will help the Sea Robbers. "You need that player who will shout at you when you lose the ball."
