Due to the escalating rate of unemployment in the country, especially among the youth, self-employment is proving to be the right tonic for youngsters such as Siphiwe Khauleza.The multitalented artist from Vredefort, northern Free State, says the youth of South Africa must not depend on government jobs to make ends meet.The 27-years-old singer, actor, voice-over artist and character model, has recently clinched a deal to be the face of Mayfield Square Mall, in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni."I have always wanted to be independent. Many young people rely on government for jobs and they forget that they can create jobs for themselves."When you have talent you need to utilise it for a living," Khauleza told Sowetan."As a young hustler I am a motivation to the youth from my disadvantaged community. I regard myself as a testimony that anything is possible in life. It all comes with respect, dedication, passion and hard work."As long as you do what you love in life you will succeed. Fame doesn't pay bills, only hard work does."

Even if you won't use [your qualification for a career] knowledge helps you."He is currently in the second year of his public relations studies with the University of South Africa.Khauleza aspires to own his own production company in the near future.Television producers Connie and Shona Fergusons are his role models "for the sterling work they are doing in the industry".
