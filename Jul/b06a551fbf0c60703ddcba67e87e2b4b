The planned closure of mining operations is likely to leave towns neighbouring Klerksdorp, businesses and communities in dire straits.Kopanang Mine, which is near Orkney and Klerksdorp, once gave the surrounding areas a boom as most mineworkers bought their goods and services in the towns.But now that the owners of the mine, Anglo Gold Ashanti, are considering its closure, the two gold mining towns and their economies are in danger.

We have to invest in other sectors."Richards said the business community was considering expanding to other sectors of the economy to remain sustainable.She said that the business chamber, together with the local municipality, had adopted a model that would ensure that the town focuses on agriculture, agro-processing, tourism and manufacturing."As a community we need to have a mind-set change because we know the mine is going to close down as mines have a certain life span."Someone who supplies protective clothing to mines, for instance, has to think differently and start supplying the product to the farmers," she said.A local hardware and supermarket manager who preferred to remain anonymous said most of his clients were mineworkers and that retrenchments would have devastating consequences for his business which employs 14 people. "Even businesses that provide low-cost accommodation to mine labourers will not be spared."
