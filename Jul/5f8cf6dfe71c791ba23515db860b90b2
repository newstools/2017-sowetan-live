The Dalai Lama will visit Botswana next month and meet with President Ian Khama. in a trip likely to anger China, a key investor across Africa and its largest trade partner. Beijing views the Dalai Lama as a separatist campaigning for Tibetan independence and consistently condemns leaders who meet him. Botswana "will be extending the normal courtesies for visiting dignitaries", the government said on Wednesday in a statement. "His Excellency [Khama] will meet the Dalai Lama when he is in Botswana." The Tibetan spiritual leader, who lives in exile in India, is due to make a public address at the three-day Mind and Life Dialogue conference in Gaborone on August 19. Botswana's neighbour South Africa has repeatedly denied the Dalai Lama a visa in an apparent attempt to further boost ties with China. This has drawn fierce criticism from Archbishop Desmond Tutu and others. China's growing demand for raw materials has seen a rapid rise in trade with Africa. The Chinese government has helped build coal-powered power plants, road networks, bridges and schools in Botswana, in some of its many projects in Africa. Many on the continent see Beijing as a counterbalance to the West, but the relationship has also raised accusations of neocolonialism. A government spokesman declined to comment on any risk to relations with China.
