There are two new caps in the Spar Proteas national team announced by Netball SA (NSA) yesterday.The team was chosen at a week-long training camp at the Pretoria University High Performance Centre.The new caps are both shooters - Danelle Lochner and Ina-Marie Venter.Lochner has just returned from the Netball World Youth Cup in Botswana, where the Baby Proteas finished in sixth place.NSA president Mimi Mthethwa-Zulu said the team had been selected for the Quad Series in Australia and New Zealand next month, and a two-Test series in Fiji.She said the Quad Series, which continues in South Africa and England next year, was part of the Proteas' build-up for the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia in August next year.Coach Norma Plummer said she was delighted with the 12 players who had been selected."Danelle came straight from the World Youth Championships and she almost selected herself."She is physically powerful and she has great maturity for a girl of 19," said Plummer."It is always good to get a player of that calibre at such an early age."Centre court player Bongi Msomi retains the captaincy of the team, with goal defence Karla Mostert as her vice-captain.Another player who has been playing overseas is shooter Lenize Potgieter, who played in the New Zealand league.Plummer said the experience gained by these senior players would add to the strength of the Proteas.
