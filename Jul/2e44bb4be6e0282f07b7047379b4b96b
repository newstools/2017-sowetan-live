Soweto giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs finally caught a wake up in the off-season player transfer by announcing major signings yesterday.Pirates unveiled Thamsanqa Sangweni on a three-year deal even though it had looked like the midfielder was headed for champions Bidvest Wits.The 28-year-old younger brother of retired Bucs defender Siyabonga, trained with Wits in the past week after he was given permission to do so by Chippa United but Pirates announced that Thami had "agreed terms on a deal that will see him part of the family until 2020"."I am very happy to have joined the club. I look forward to making a positive contribution to the team and help the team to bounce back to where we all know it belongs," Sangweni told the club's website."I would like to thank the chairman [Chippa Mpengesi], the staff and the supporters of Chippa United for all they have done for me, I will be forever grateful."Wits coach Gavin Hunt was reluctant to comment on how the player he was so keen to sign slipped through their radar."It's one of those things... speak to people who make the deals. I can't comment," Hunt said.Attempts to reach Wits chief executive Jose Ferreira were in vain as his phone was unanswered and he did not respond to an SMS either.Chiefs, meanwhile, confirmed that they have welcomed another Zimbabwean international to their stable, Teenage Hadebe, 21, who joined from Chicken Inn, as well as Philani Zulu, 28, from Maritzburg United.The two players signed for three years with the option to extend and were part of the Amakhosi team that started their pre-season training yesterday, the club said."We have been working throughout the break to negotiate and finalise some of these deals," said Amakhosi's football manager, Bobby Motaung in a statement.According to Chiefs, Hadebe trained with the club during last year's pre-season but the club could not sign him then.Komphela previously worked with Zulu, who came "highly recommended because of his skill and versatility", the Chiefs statement read.The Premier Soccer League said the domestic player transfer window, which officially opened yesterday, will close on August 31.
