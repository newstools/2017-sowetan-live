Cape Town City captain Lebogang Manyama believes working with new coach Benni McCarthy will help take his game to the next level.Manyama, who's nominated for the PSL Footballer of the Season Award, finished as the league's top scorer with 13 goals. He also scored one more in cup competitions.The 26-year-old is confident that the presence of Bafana Bafana's all-time leading goal scorer will aid his game, especially in terms of finishing."Personally, I scored 13 and would love to score more (next season). We all know what Benni has done; he's probably one of the best finishers in South Africa and I'm looking to learn from him," said Manyama, who was speaking at the PSL offices in Parktown, Johannesburg, yesterday.He was at the league's offices to talk about his nomination for the main award.Bidvest Wits captain Thulani Hlatshwayo and his Mamelodi Sundowns counterpart Hlompho Kekana, who are also nominated, shared the stage with him."I did miss a whole lot of chances and could probably have doubled what I scored, so I'm looking forward to working with him," he continued.Manyama is the frontrunner for the main awards - the Players' Player of the Season and Telkom Knockout Player of the Tournament categories - while he's guaranteed the top scorer award."I have to be confident that I will take it (the top award), but at the same time I have to be humble and respect the two gentlemen that are here (Hlatshwayo and Kekana)," Manyama stated."Like Hlompho said, it's a proud moment to be here. We will see what happens on the night."The PSL awards will be held at Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg on Monday.
