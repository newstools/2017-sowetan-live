Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane has backed himself to become the club's number one in the new season.None of the Bucs keepers made the number one jersey their own in the just-concluded campaign. Mabokgwane, 29, who was in his first season with Pirates, was competing with Brighton Mhlongo and Siyabonga Mpontshane.The Polokwane-born goalminder had his best moments at times, like when he kept five clean sheets in 11 league matches. But many will remember that he was between the sticks when Mamelodi Sundowns put six past him in February, a game that led to a pitch invasion by Pirates supporters at Loftus Stadium.Mabokgwane, however, is grateful for the lessons and is looking forward to doing better next season."I've been at smaller teams where there is not too much pressure. You can make a mistake and it's forgotten, but at a big club you need to make sure that you don't make silly mistakes," the former Mpumalanga Black Aces keeper told Sowetan."You have to be on top of your game all the time. It's not been discouraging for me - it's a lesson because had I not come to Pirates, I would probably have been still in my comfort zone," Mabokgwane argued."Personally, I think my performance was good and when it was bad, it was terrible. I must learn from my mistakes."My performances were good in [some of] the games I played," he said, adding that he was ready to claim the number one spot next season. "I have to be consistent, that's the only thing I lacked. I'm definitely ready to take over the number one jersey."
