The Hawks suspect the burglary at Promat Building, its headquarters in Silverton, Pretoria, early yesterday was an inside job.Besides breaking the door of an office where they stole a number of computers, the brazen thugs did not seem to have forced entry into the high-security offices.Spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said: "We have strict security measures [at the headquarters]. Anybody who gets inside our building has to pass through security."The security entails security guards and the use of access cards. Mulaudzi said computers were stolen from the finance, supply chain management and human resource management offices. "No docket has gone missing," he said.The computers had confidential information of employees of the Hawks. Mulaudzi said a crack team had been set up to investigate the burglary.The Hawks became the second state institution to be broken into this year. Fifteen computers containing information on judges were stolen from the highly secured office of Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng in Midrand earlier in the year.Meanwhile, traffic authorities in Pretoria are worried a criminal syndicate is possibly targeting its computers running the National Traffic Information System (eNatis).Services came to a halt at the Centurion licensing station yesterday, after a brazen break-in by thugs who made off with a number of computers. Staff realised computers were missing when they reported for duty yesterday morning.Isaac Mahamba, spokesman for the Tshwane Metro Police Department, confirmed that eNatis IT system was stolen.The testing station in Waltloo, east of the city, also saw a similar break-in a few weeks ago."We're worried because the same items that were stolen in Waltloo are the same items that are missing right here," Mahamba said."However, we don't want to confirm that [there are thugs targeting the eNatis system], but that's what we're investigating." He said the city's mayor Solly Msimanga would announce the measures at a press briefing scheduled for today.Authorities estimated items worth R1-million were stolen.People hoping to test for their driver's or learner's licences were sent back without assistance. Mahamba said the centre would open today, but would be using skeleton staff for certain services.
