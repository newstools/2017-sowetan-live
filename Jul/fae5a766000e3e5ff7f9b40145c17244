Keletso "Mr Cava" Nkadimeng's undying love for fashion saw him put his information technology (IT) diploma on hold to follow his passion for fashion design.His nickname derives from his clothing design company, Cava Clothing. Though the company was registered in 2015, Nkadimeng, 24, had been selling branded clothing since 2012 from his home in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni.His focus is on branding caps, T-shits, sweaters, hoodies, jackets and backpacks, mainly for a young clientele."I financed my business from my savings. I also received a lot of assistance from friends who came through when I needed money," he said.He now employs two people."[At the beginning] I received a lot of criticism from my family. They were critical about my career choice considering they had invested a lot for me to acquire a diploma."I worked very hard to convince them that this is what I loved. It wasn't easy but at the end they supported me."

In fact, it left me without money most of the time. I sacrificed a lot to make my business unique and appealing and I don't have any regrets," he said.Nkadimeng said he had to do extra work on the side."I made school uniforms, name tags and T-shirts, among other things, to generate income."Nkadimeng markets his business by having photo shoots for every clothing item he produces and posting them on social media."I also market my products at small private clothing stores and showcase them at township fashion shows."Nkadimeng has big dreams."I would like to see myself grow up to opening my own store... and manufacture my own clothes."The soft-spoken designer recently ventured into the water packaging business to widen his business interests."I was able to branch into the water business because of the proceeds made from the clothing business."We need more clients for the business to grow but we are doing well."I would like to produce my own energy drink one day," he said.
