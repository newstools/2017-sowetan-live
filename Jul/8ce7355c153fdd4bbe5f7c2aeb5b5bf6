Bafana striker Ryan Moon is delighted to have scored on debut for the national team.Moon, 20, was on the score sheet and Gift Motupa added a second to guide Bafana to a 2-0 win over Botswana in Francistown in their 2018 African Nations Championship qualifier."I feel great and I want to give God all the glory. Even today I'm still happy and I want to get more and more [goals]," said Moon, who plays for Kaizer Chiefs. "It's true when they say dreams do come true . I mean, I spoke about hoping to be in the line-up, to sing the national anthem and score a goal. All those things [have] happened."Moon draws inspiration from older brother, Bryce, who has represented the country 19 times. "I made him proud and that's a great feeling," he said."My phone was buzzing with all my family and friends sending messages [after the match]."When I got back to the hotel, I phoned my mother and them. They put me on speaker so I spoke to my mother, father and my brothers. Obviously, they were really excited for me."Commenting on the match, Moon said Bafana had the right approach to the match and deserved their win."It was always tough and it was hot in the first half, but we had a good game plan and we stuck to it."We didn't worry about them playing and we took our chances, which was the most important thing. We could have won by more than two goals, maybe four or five. But the most important thing is that we got a good result away from home."The second leg is set for Saturday at Moruleng Stadium, near Rustenburg at 3pm.Moon joins the likes of Doctor Khumalo, Dumisa Ngobe, Mpho Makola, the late John Shoes Moshoeu, Phil Masinga, Jabu Pule, Katlego Mphela, Thabo Mnyamane, Bongani Ndulula and Gardner Seale as players to have scored on debut for Bafana.
