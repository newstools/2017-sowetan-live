The push for expropriation of land without compensation is such a radical policy shift that it is likely to plunge the country into "deeper crises".This is according to ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe who voiced his concern yesterday on the sidelines of the party's national policy conference in Nasrec, south of Johannesburg.President Jacob Zuma's supporters in the economic transformation commissions were pushing to have land expropriation without compensation be adopted as the policy of the governing party.The commission resolved to "propose the amendment of section 25 of the country's constitution to make provision for expropriation of land without compensation", said a source who was part of the commission.ANC talks big on landMantashe said such drastic policy shifts were called for amid panicking in the ANC because "you want to get instant solutions now and win back the support you are losing and win popularity instantly. And you do things that are extreme.""Our experience looking into other revolutions is that every time once you do that you deal with issues haphazardly and dig deeper into crises. Let me give an example, when there is factionalism populism people tend to go to extremes."Mantashe also said the veterans "missed out" after they decided to boycott the conference. He said they did not just miss out on an important opportunity to self reflect, but some of the leaders acted in bad faith during the discussions.
