Veteran boxing promoter Jeff Ellis, of African Ring and Golden Gloves promotions, has commended Boxing SA (BSA) for ordering 80 licensed professional fighters who are over 35 years of age to go for brain scan."At 35 or over, you must have been in so many fights, so a medical examination is a must," said the 65-year-old Ellis who has been involved in boxing for 45 years."I took Deejay Kriel for both eye and brain tests on Tuesday for his upcoming WBC International mini-flyweight title fight against Dexter Alimento from the Philippines, on July 23, at Emperors Palace" said Ellis .The Boxing Act No 11 of 2001 requires boxers who are over 35 to submit themselves to a medical examination for the renewal of their licenses."People might get angry, but these medical tests must be done to avoid life-threatening injuries toboxers," said Ellis.He made an example of Kobus Fourie who was outpointed by debutant Andre Thysse in 1999."He lost his next three fights by stoppages and retired. Then 17 years later, at 38, he wanted to make a comeback but was not relicensed for health reasons," said Ellis.Some of the boxers in BSA's list for brain scan are current SA light heavyweight holder Ryno Liebenberg, 33, former SA junior featherweight champion Bongani Mahlangu, 37, and mony others.
