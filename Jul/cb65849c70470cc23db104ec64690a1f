Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana must be a tired man after playing in all competitions this season, but resting is not an option for the Zebediela, Limpopo-born midfielder.Kekana has registered 40 appearances in the 2016/17 season in all competitions and missed several matches due to injuries but whenever he plays, the tough-tackling midfielder never disappoints.His nomination for this year's Absa Premiership Footballer of the Season alongside Cape Town City midfielder Lebogang Manyama and Bidvest Wits defender Thulani Hlatshwayo, attests to that.Asked how he manages to stay in form despite playing so many games, Kekana cited his ability to take responsibility and the fear of letting his "people" down as the contributing factors."It goes back to my responsibility as a player. I am not only representing myself but a lot of people back in the villages [in Limpopo] where people believe in me."I cannot disappoint people who believe in me. Even if it is difficult, I will always try to remain on top of my game," said Kekana yesterday.He helped Sundowns clinch a last-eight spot in the CAF Champions League after beating Ethiopian side St George 1-0 in their penultimate Group C match on Saturday.The 32-year-old feels playing in the CAF Champions League makes players mentally strong.
