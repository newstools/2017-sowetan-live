Disciplining Makhosi Khoza will not solve the leadership crisis in the ANC, nor the lack of discipline in its ranks or the poor quality of party leaders.In fact the ANC doesn't have a moral, ethical or political leg to stand on. The reason is simple: it has to discipline President Jacob Zuma to regain its standing.Several ANC leaders support Khoza in her opinion of Zuma and they have not been charged. Mondli Gungubele adopted this stance last week, saying he will not toe the party line and will vote against Zuma during the upcoming motion of no confidence against him.It is public knowledge that Zuma has disregarded the ANC constitution as well as the constitution of the country, so the ANC does not have the authority to take action against the outspoken Khoza.Regarding KwaZulu-Natal, the province that has charged Khoza, we are yet to hear about any action taken against the provincial youth league that broke a court order and booed and disrupted ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize and former finance minister Pravin Gordhan at a memorial lecture in honour of the late Ahmed Kathrada.The move against Khoza is factional and has nothing to do with restoring discipline.Last week Zuma's son, Edward, wrote an open letter insulting senior ANC leaders - something he has done on other occasions.In the letter, the president's son accused Gordhan and Derek Hanekom of being sell-outs.The Human Rights Commission is set to investigate Edward because the contents of the letter promote hate speech.The ANC on Friday said Edward's remarks had to be handled by his branch - but after the commission's announcement the party condemned Edward.Edward is based in the same province that has charged Khoza.When Zuma is in a corner he returns to KwaZulu-Natal to revive his spirit - as if the province is his personal playground.KwaZulu-Natal is deeply divided, as Khoza rightfully says.Its provincial executive committee under the leadership of Sihle Zikalala might well be dismissed if the court finds in favour of the members that are challenging the conference that elected them.Despite running home and addressing the public in deep Zulu as if the rest of the nation won't understand, the president is also guilty of factionalism.The ANC integrity commission, whose decisions are known to be binding, said Zuma must go - yet he remains in power because he believes he is above the ANC.At the ANC national policy conference Zuma took a swipe at those who called on him to step down, saying they don't have the power to remove him.Those like Derek Hanekom, who have challenged him in meetings, have been insulted.That is why Zuma's son can pen a letter and insult the party's leaders.Until Zuma is disciplined, any move against those who oppose him amounts to nothing but factional purging.
