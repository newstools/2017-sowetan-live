Thulani Serero was delighted to be back on the pitch, even if just for a training game as pre-season preparations with his new Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem got underway at the weekend.And there has been a word of encouragement from new Bafana Bafana boss Stuart Baxter, who said he was delighted to know that the 27-year-old midfielder is back after a year in enforced exile and can again be considered for the national team.Baxter did not pick Serero for last month's trip to Nigeria for the African Nations Cup qualifier due to his lack of game time in his last season at Ajax Amsterdam, where he was thrown out of the first team and banished off to play in the reserves because the coach said he was not part of his plans.But Serero has now signed to play at Vitesse and was in action at the weekend when they played their first pre-season friendly against a visiting club from Ukraine, FC Oleksandria."It was important for me to get some match time," he said after the game.The Soweto-born midfielder, who made his name at Ajax Cape Town, is one of several reinforcements that Vitesse signed in their preparation for Uefa Europa League football this coming season.Serero has Uefa experience with 11 appearances for Ajax. "He even played against Barcelona," said his new teammate Thomas Bruns.Said Serero's new coach Henk Fraser: "He has a great attitude, it may not take him long to get back his rhythm."
