There have been so many draws between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates that predicting the winner is unheard of. Coaches and players from both sides have also shied away from predicting the outcome, but that changed yesterday when Chiefs coach Steve Komphela dared to predict the score ahead of tomorrow's match at FNB Stadium (3.30pm). "I don't think it's proper that we should tell them how are we going to score, but a 2-0 [win] will do. Hate [it] or like [it] we called it, 2-0," reiterated Komphela during a media briefing at Absa Contact Centre in Auckland Park, Johannesburg. This is a man who has not had the best of times in this clash, specifically in official matches. Since joining Chiefs in 2015, he has lost two, drawn three and his only official win was in a penalty shootout in the Telkom Knockout semifinals almost two years ago.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads Komphela is expected to stick with the team that beat Mamelodi Sundowns 2-1 in Pretoria on Tuesday. He deployed five defenders with Joseph Molangoane as a wing back. "Some people will say if it ain't broke why fix it, but some will say bring in an element of surprise," said Komphela, who was mindful of fans' expectations. Not to be outdone, Bucs mentor Milutin "Micho" Sredojevic was equally confident as he engaged the media on what the club's supporters can expect. "With respect to my colleague [Komphela], but I wouldn't be sitting here if I don't believe in what we are doing. I also believe [we will win] 2-0," he said. Unlike Komphela, the Serbian will be involved in the Soweto derby for only the second time. During his first brief stint at Pirates in 2006, he met Chiefs once and they played to a 1-1 draw. "We are ready for the challenge in front of us. The game of this magnitude has tension and pressure, but I would like for all the tension and pressure to stay with me and the technical team," Sredojevic added.
