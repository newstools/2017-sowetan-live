Kaizer Chiefs striker Bernard Parker feels his beleaguered team has turned adversity into opportunity as they eye the double over fellow juggernauts Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates. Amakhosi, it appears, have taken a nothing-to-lose attitude as they prepare to face their archrivals Pirates at FNB Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm). "The thing about us at Chiefs is that we can never give up just because the results are not going our way. You can't just throw your hands and think that will solve our problems," Parker said. "It was a good feeling to win against Sundowns and we will continue to give our all to ensure the result goes our way against Pirates."ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads Parker was relieved to score his first goal in 20 games in the win over Sundowns. "Any striker will tell you it's an unbelievable feeling. That's what you want to repeat every match day." Their opponents, the Buccaneers, will look to snap their recent slump after two draws and a loss in their last three games. On Wednesday they were held by bottom-of-the-table Platinum Stars to a 1-1 draw after goals from Thabo Matlaba and Bongi Ntuli. Matlaba expects a good response from the Sea Robbers in the derby. "As a team we will put up a strong effort to put a smile on the faces of our fans. We are up for the challenge against Chiefs. As Pirates we have a duty to win games," he said. Â
