Military operations were under way yesterday near Niger's border with Mali, the day after an attack by unidentified assailants which killed three members of the US Army Special Forces and five Nigerian soldiers, security sources said yesterday. The attack, which also saw two US soldiers wounded, took place during a routine patrol in one part of southwestern Niger where there are known (active) insurgents, including from the al-Qaeda, a US official said. Nigerian, French and US troops were conducting military operations in the zone yesterday, a Nigerian security source said without giving out more information. An official at Mali's defence ministry said military operations were taking place within Niger and that Malian forces had reinforced their checkpoints along the border.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads According to a Nigerian diplomatic source, those who carried out Wednesday's attack came from Mali. Jihadist groups form part of a growing regional insurgency in the poor, sparsely populated deserts of west Africa's Sahel. They have stepped up attacks on UN peacekeepers, Malian soldiers and civilian targets after being driven back in northern Mali by a French-led military intervention in 2013.
