Young people growing up in rural Africa need jobs where they live, so they are not forced to join the growing ranks of the poor seeking work in cities or to make dangerous journeys to reach Europe. By 2030, there will be about 1.3billion 15- to 24-year-olds on the planet, some 100million more than in 2015. Most of that increase will be in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said at the launch of its annual State of Food and Agriculture report this week. Industrial and service sectors in African and South Asian cities have not grown enough to meet the demand, and won't absorb the millions of new job seekers wanting to escape grinding poverty and hunger in their rural homes, the FAO said.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads "In Africa, every year 10 to 12million youths join the labour force, but we have only been providing about three million jobs . So it is not a surprise that they try to cross the desert and the Mediterranean looking for a better opportunity," said FAO director-general Jos√© Graziano da Silva. Rural areas are not doomed to be poverty traps and could thrive with more investment in farming and food industries and better infrastructure linking farms and rural businesses to meet the rising demand for food in cities, the report said. "People can get out of poverty even if they stay in rural areas," said Marco Sanchez-Cantillo, acting director of FAO's Agricultural Development Economics Division. "There are parts of the world where rural transformations have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty."
