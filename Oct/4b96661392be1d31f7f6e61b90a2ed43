In light of the looming Soweto Derby on Saturday, the commission of inquiry into the FNB Stadium stampede that left two people dead at the last meeting between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates is yet to gain momentum. This also applies to the investigation into the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc). Both inquiries were set up by the Sports Ministry in August. "It is foreseen that both committees of inquiry will commence with their respective mandates once their terms of references have been published in the Government Gazette - hopefully, on Friday," said Mickey Modisane, from the Sports Ministry's communications department. "Both committees will first invite persons to testify at the public hearings ... Should they fail to attend, they may be subpoenaed."ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads Â  The ministerial committee - chaired by Judge Ronny Pillay - was set up by Sports Minister Thulas Nxesi three weeks after the FNB Stadium disaster, the same day he also announced the probe on Sascoc. Briefing the sports portfolio committee last month, Nxesi said some of the terms of reference include: whether any conduct or omission by any person or body contravened the act; advise on the effectiveness of the current regulation and administration of soccer matches and recommend ways to eliminate any deficiencies. The PSL discontinued its own inquiry last month. Advocate Vincent Maleka, who was appointed to chair the investigation, did not have the powers to subpoena. The PSL had promised to release a full report within 14 days after the incident, but they missed the deadline. Similarly, the ministerial committees were given a month to report back to Nxesi. But it emerged during last month's briefing before the portfolio committee that the timeframe has been extended to three months at the advice of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.
