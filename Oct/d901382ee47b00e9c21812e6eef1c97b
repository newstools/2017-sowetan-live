Springbok coach Allister Coetzee's challenge after Saturday's thrilling Test at Newlands is to somehow find a way for his team to repeat the intensity shown against the All Blacks every time they play. The All Blacks won a thriller 25-24 but the Boks returned to basics using their sheer physical power to create problems for the visitors. Coetzee praised the effort and commiserated with his players after the match because there was much to admire about the performance. "There are a lot of things that make me so positive about this team and we really feel that we are heading in the right direction," Coetzee said.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads All Blacks coach Steve Hansen was one of only a few people not surprised by the Springboks' performance on the day. After winning 57-0 in Albany three weeks earlier, Hansen repeatedly warned of a Springbok backlash. "We tried to tell anyone who would listen that even though that scoreline looked ridiculous in Albany, it was just one of those game where we took every opportunity, but this time around we didn't. "The Boks grew in belief. and put us under pressure. "South Africans will be very proud of that performance. "The Boks never disappoint us, they always turn up and are a very good rugby side. They showed real courage and character, and forced us to make so many tackles." The Boks leave in three weeks for the end-of-year tour to take on Ireland, France, Italy and Wales.
