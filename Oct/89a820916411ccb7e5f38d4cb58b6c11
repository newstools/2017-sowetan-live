There appears to be a disjuncture between what Kaizer Chiefs practise on the training ground and what happens during official games, says defender Lorenzo Gordinho. Amakhosi need to start delivering on the field of play after a substandard start to the season. The Telkom Knockout, which kicks off next week, will provide the perfect platform for them to gather steam after they were drawn against PSL returnees AmaZulu in the first round. Chiefs could do with some reprieve from the league where they have two losses, two wins and three draws.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads "The guys are willing to perform for him [coach Steve Komphela], whether it's a big or small game. Just because we don't get the results does not mean he is not doing his job and we are not doing ours," said Gordinho. Chiefs' immediate priority, though, is their clash against Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versveld tonight (7.30pm) and against Orlando Pirates on Saturday. "We have a responsibility as Chiefs players to perform and win games. "We have to win both games, there is no other way about it. It will be an intense week. There will be pressure, but we have to enjoy that pressure because everybody wants to play in a packed stadium and feel the heat," he added. Their opponents in the Telkom Cup, AmaZulu, will have a point to prove in their first cup match since returning to the top flight. Usuthu midfielder Ovidy Karuru has emphasised that he will have nothing to prove to his previous employers in the tie. "I am enjoying myself at AmaZulu and I have nothing to prove to Chiefs," said Karuru. "I cannot wait to play against them because I have friends there and I want to win against them. "I know that we will be underdogs, but in a cup anything can happen."
