Doing well in commercial subjects at high school is what motivated Glen Ntuli to pursue his dream to become a chartered accountant. Ntuli is a co-founder and chief executive officer of MNB Chartered Accountants (MNBCA), a financial services company tailored for customers and business entities of various sizes. "Commercial subjects were the in-thing when I started high school, so I fell for (them) and did well. When I passed matric I chose to go to the University of the Western Cape as it was cheaper,'' Ntuli told Sowetan. Ntuli completed his BCom degree in accounting from UWC and also holds a BCom Accounting Honours degree from the University of South Africa. After his qualifications he went on to do his SAICA articles/traineeship at PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The 34-year-old CA established his accounting firm in 2013 after resigning from what he terms "a good position in corporate banking" to focus on growing his own business. "The business has since grown tremendously and has 25 employees, which includes three chartered accountants,'' said the entre-preneur who was born in Giyani, Limpopo. Ntuli's dream is to own a huge commercial property portfolio which would develop and create employment opportunities for the people in under-developed communities. He believes his achievements should motivate other young people who are living in disadvantaged communities. "As a young man who was born and grew up in a village without necessary infrastructure such as electricity, running water, among others, I am a good example to young people that success is certain when a person is determined to achieve their goals."
