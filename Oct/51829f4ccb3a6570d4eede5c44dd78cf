It was 21 years ago when Trevor Beukes made a prophecy that's come to pass. The die-hard Mamelodi Sundowns supporter bestowed the name of Rivaldo on his son in honour of the former Brazilian playmaker in the hope that he would someday become a football sensation. Fast-forward to this day and his son, Rivaldo Coetzee, is one of the biggest football stars in South Africa - and he recently became a Brazilian. Not the famous Selecao, but the Brazilians of Mamelodi.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads "I don't know, maybe he [his father] planned all of this when I was born," Rivaldo says. "My dad is delighted about this move because he was always a Downs fan, he always liked anything that had to do with Brazil." Coetzee joined Sundowns on transfer deadline day from Ajax Cape Town for what is believed to have been a record transfer fee between PSL clubs of R12-million. The defender settled for a switch to the Tshwane club after a botched transfer to Glasgow Rangers in Scotland following the discovery of a broken bone in his right foot. The Bafana Bafana international has never been afraid of a challenge since leaving his hometown of Kakamas in Northen Cape for Cape Town at 15. "I am adjusting well to being up here [in Gauteng] on a full-time basis. For me to progress, I realised I needed to get out of my comfort zone," he says. "I can't wait to start training with the guys. I already knew a few guys from the national team like Percy Tau, Hlompho Kekana, Sibusiso Vilakazi and Tebogo Langerman so it won't be hard to fit in." When Coetzee returns to fitness he is expected to slot into central defence alongside Motjeka Madisha. He won't be out of place in the colours of the Brazilians and will certainly look to become a hero for his team just like his namesake was for the South American juggernauts.
