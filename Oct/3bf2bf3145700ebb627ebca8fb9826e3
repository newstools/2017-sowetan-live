The Cosafa Women's Championship title-holders, Banyana Banyana, showed no signs of complacency when they thumped a rusty looking Burkina Faso 4-0 in an international friendly at Dobsonville Stadium yesterday. Banyana's intentions to win were clear from the opening stages of the match but their poor finishing let them down on many occasions. Thembi Kgatlana wasted two glorious chances midway through the first half. However, the home side's intensity paid off in the 33rd minute when defender Lebohang Ramalepe's header, from a corner kick, deflected off Ouedrago Rafiatou and in, making it 1-0 to Banyana. It was given as an own goal.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads After scoring four goals at last month's Cosafa Championship in Zimbabwe, Leandra Smeda continued with her fine form, giving the hosts their second goal on the stroke of half time. SA keeper Andile Dlamini was hardly tested throughout the first period. You could tell that the west Africans have been inactive for a while - their last match was against Ghana in 201. They were inept, to say the least. Their rustiness saw them make two forced changes in the first stanza as players suffered from cramp and looked unfit. Banyana coach Desiree Ellis must have said something to Kgatlana at half time as the striker netted a brace to make it 4-0 midway through the second half. Kgatlana was voted the best player of the match. Â
