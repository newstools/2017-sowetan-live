Veteran AmaZulu and former Bafana Bafana striker Siyabonga "Bhele" Nomvethe has credited dedication, family stability and living a good lifestyle as some of the reasons for his longevity, which has seen him extend his lead as the all-time leading PSL goal scorer with 120 goals. The 39-year-old equalised for AmaZulu in their crucial 2-1 win over Mamelodi Sundowns at Lucas Moripe Stadium at the weekend. Nomvethe, who turns 40 on December 2, has also played for other clubs in the PSL including Soweto giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows. The only active player to have lasted two decades in the PSL is Bidvest Wits goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs. "It all comes down to dedication. I also spend a lot of time with my family and I work very hard at training so that I am always fit," said Nomvethe after AmaZulu handed Sundowns their third home defeat of the season in Atteridgeville. "I don't know when I will stop playing because my legs can still carry me. "I never expected to reach this age while still playing professionally." Nomvethe added that he wants to become an example to younger players. "Age is just a number, I am just making sure that I make use of the opportunity that I have to inspire others. "There are youngsters that I have seen who can play for Bafana Bafana, for the junior national teams or even go to Europe, but they waste their talent because of doing things that are not right," he said. "I want those who are still playing to look at me and Mabhuti Khenyeza. We love and respect football because it has given us a lot." Khenyeza, who scored the winner for AmaZulu against the Brazilians, increased his tally to 107 in the PSL and is now one behind legendary Sundowns striker Daniel "Mambush" Mudau, who retired after registering 108 goals in the all-time list (of goal scorers in the PSL).
