Lewis Hamilton may have partied in Texas with his Mercedes team after his US Grand Prix triumph but he has no intention of relaxing as he targets the title in Mexico next weekend. Hamilton's fifth win in six races since August has not only propelled him to within comfortable reach of his fourth world crown, but also squeezed the vigour from rival Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari's challenge. As Mercedes celebrated their fourth consecutive constructors' championship win following a Hamilton master-class at the Circuit of the Americas, four-time former champion Vettel was left to admit he and his team lacked the speed to match them. "We were not fast enough and that's it," said Vettel, visibly disappointed at failing to mount a challenge for victory once Hamilton had recovered from losing the initiative at the start and passed him on lap six.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads He added: "Congratulations to Lewis and Mercedes." But his body language had already betrayed the feeling that Hamilton's ninth win of the season, fifth in six visits to Texas and the 62nd of his career had been a blow of near knock-out power. Hamilton was not only dominant, but supremely so in Sunday's eventful race as he controlled the pace and tyre-wear to perfection, larked around with multiple Olympic champion Usain Bolt and played to a big crowd that gave him warm support. "It's not done yet, but it feels great to be in this position," said the champ. "I am going to Mexico to win again next weekend. I am so proud of this team. "Everyone has worked so hard and I am just privileged to be part of it," Hamilton added.
