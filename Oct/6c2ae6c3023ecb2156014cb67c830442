While some footballers would rather sit on the fence and never dare to predict the MTN8 final between Cape Town City and SuperSport United, some have no problems picking the winner, and most of those we spoke to are going with the Citizens. Lebogang Manyama: former Cape Town City and SuperSport United forward "Benni [McCarthy] or [Eric] Tinkler? Whoever wins, I will be happy for him. It's the same as the players ... "I have close friends in both teams and pity they all can't win. May the best team win."ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads Mark Mayambela: Chippa United "City will win. One of my favourite players is Thabo [Nodada], they are captained by my former colleague (Robyn Johannes) and I have a lot of friends there. "Ayanda Patosi is from my hood (Khayelitsha). Besides that, I'm confident City can win because of the type of players they have - players like Patosi, [Lehlohonolo] Majoro and Teko Modise have played high-level football. Benni was also coached by one of the best coaches in Jose Mourinho and I'm sure he has learnt a lot from him. Of course, SuperSport have great players, but I still back City." Gift Motupa: Baroka "As much as I would like my former coach Eric Tinkler to win it, I am giving it to Cape Town City. Majoro and Patosi will play a big role. "I think Benni needs it more than SuperSport and they [City] are on form." Tapelo Nyongo: AmaZulu "I give it to City, but they will win in penalties. "I trust their hunger will motivate them. "SuperSport might suffer from complacency as they have already won the Nedbank Cup." Thabiso Semenya: Polokwane City " I'm going with SuperSport United because my friend Thuso Phala is there. I want him to have the champions' medal." Prince Nxumalo: Ajax Cape Town "I am vouching for SuperSport. "They have been in the finals more than City, which gives them an advantage. They will win it in extra-time."
