It was another day to forget for local road runners as their foreign counterparts continued their supremacy of the FNB 10K City Surf Run yesterday. Yesterday's event was an inaugural Durban leg of the "Run Your City" series after the Cape Town 12 and Joburg 10K city runs. Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda clinched the 10km coastal city race, clocking an impressive time of 27 minutes and 28 seconds - the fastest time this year as well as a new Ugandan record. Cheptegei shattered the SA all-comers record of 27:55 set by Richard Kimi in Port Elizabeth in 2014. Local ace Stephen Mokoka was the first South African home in a time of 28:34. He was among the chasing pack from the first kilometre but could not maintain his great start after showing signs of fatigue mid-way through the race. Cheptegei, 22, who took home R25000, credited his victory to the experience he gained at the recent IAAF World Championships in London where he clinched a silver medal in the 10000m behind Britain's Mo Farah. "It shows that am growing as an athlete. I learnt a lot in London [at the World Champs ]. Today I told myself that I must not hold back and just ran fast from the start," said Cheptegei. "Competing against the likes of Farah benefited me a lot. I'll be glad to come back next year and win again." The Ugandans' dominance was also felt in the women's race as Mercyline Chelangat won in 31:37. More than 6 000 runners took to the streets of Durban yesterday. Van Zyl finished in 35.08 minutes, beating Molotsane by 19 seconds. Nolene Conrad was third in 36.39.
