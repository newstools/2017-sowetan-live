The increase in the number of abused women and children drove a North West teacher to swap careers in 1990. Now detective Mokgatlhe Mokgatlhe, 52, is the recipient of a provincial special award for his dedication and hard work. "I love where there is peace. I could not do that as a teacher. I grew up wanting to be a teacher, but this profession suited me much better," he said at the SAPS annual service excellence award event on Thursday. Mokgatlhe, who is based with the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit at Rustenburg police station, said his wife, a police officer, was also a victim of crime. "I worked even harder after my wife and her younger sister were shot dead [in 2013] by the husband to my wife's younger sister. .." The widower is now raising two children, aged seven and 10 by himself. "My wife's death taught me how to be a responsible father. Today (yesterday) I took my children to work because there was no one to look after them. When I work night shift, relatives take care of them." One of his most successful cases was arresting a man who raped 20 girls under the age of 12. "I could not believe that I could link him with all the 20 cases from the same area." He was also applauded for the conviction of two accused who received 40 and 30 years for rape and robbery committed between 2011 and 2014. "You can't have a better life without sweating. The sugar is where the thorn is." Lieutenant-General Bonang Mgwenya, the deputy national commissioner for human resource management, said police officials must strive to be ahead of criminals who terrorise communities. "We must work tirelessly where we are posted to make not just SAPS, but South Africa a better place for all." Mokgatlhe was awarded a certificate and R10000.
