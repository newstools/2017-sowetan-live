Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen has justified the signing of striker Thomas Chideu from Ajax Cape Town, despite the Zimbabwean having only played two games for the Urban Warriors. The 23-year-old, who spent two seasons at Ajax, is not in contention to make his debut against Baroka in their Absa Premiership top-of-the-table clash at the Peter Mokaba Stadium tonight (7.30pm). Chideu completed his move to Arrows after undergoing trials for two weeks, joining the prolific duo of Lerato Lamola and Knox Mutizwa who have forged a good understanding in Larsen's strike force. Larsen rates his latest acquisition highly and is adamant that he will give Abafana Bes'thende more options upfront.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads "We have been always on the lookout for a striker of his calibre. He is a big imposing player, which is something we did not have in the team. He brings a different dimension and he will give us more options when we attack. "You cannot judge someone who was not given a chance. I will give him a chance and people will be shocked because I am confident that he is one of the best strikers in the league. We had one foreign space and he has filled it, so I am now content with my squad," the coach said. Larsen - recently voted Premiership Coach of the Month for August-September - used the just-concluded Fifa week to give his fringe players an opportunity in a friendly against a National First Division side Royal Eagle last week to build up for tonight's epic fixture. Arrows and Baroka remain the Premiership's only unbeaten sides so far this season.
