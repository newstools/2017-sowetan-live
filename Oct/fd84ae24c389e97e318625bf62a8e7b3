Former Orlando Pirates striker Jerry Sikhosana doesn't see the team's current frontmen breaking down the Kaizer Chiefs defence in the Soweto Derby at FNB Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm). During his heyday, "Legs of Thunder" used to trouble ex-Chiefs goalkeeper Brian Baloyi. It used to be a Sikhosana v Baloyi situation, but now there are no real match-ups. "The striking department at Pirates is so poor. [Thamsanqa] Gabuza might get one, but you need a prolific goal-scorer and someone you can always rely on when the chips are down," Sikhosana explained. Instead, Sikhosana believes Chiefs are better equipped in their attack.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads "I mean, this is where Chiefs look good. They can call on Bernard Parker and you will never know if Gustavo Paez will be back [from injury]. "With Pirates, you only have Gabuza and he's not prolific, but he does make others play around him. "My fear is that the young [Siyabonga] Ngezana is going to mark him out of the game," he continued. Pirates, who are third on the log, have scored seven goals in eight league matches, while fourth-placed Chiefs have netted 10 from the same number of matches. As much as Sikhosana expects Pirates to struggle up front, he has predicted a draw - and who would disagree? After all, the last 10 league derbies have produced seven draws. "I don't expect much [from the derby], really. It's going to be the same old story where we see both teams play to a draw," he said. Did You Know? The last player to score a hat-trick in the Soweto Derby was Jerry Sikhosana, who got three in Pirates' 4-1 win in November 1996. It's been 21 years. "Yeses, it's been such a long time," he commented.
