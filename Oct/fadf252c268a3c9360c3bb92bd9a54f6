Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane admits that the team's recent rough patch is giving him sleepless nights. The Brazilians suffered their third loss of the season at home, going down 2-1 to Amazulu at the weekend. The CAF Champions League holders have suffered back-to-back defeats after having also been beaten 2-1 by Kaizer Chiefs last week. Results haven't been going Sundowns' way since their CAF Champions League exit last month. They are winless at home in the league while having a 100% record on opposition territory. The reigning CAF Coach of the Year has lambasted the officiating from referee Daniel Bennet while playing against Usuthu. Sundowns will look to bounce back in the Telkom Knockout first round against Chippa United at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Sunday. "Maybe it's better because it's away [cup tie against Chippa], we will try to get something," he said. "It's difficult, I also [not just the players] need to get motivated. Do you think I will sleep tonight?" Perhaps Sundowns are not yet over their debilitating elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Moroccans Wydad Casablanca. Former Sundowns and Chiefs defender David Kannemeyer felt that Mosimane could not be faulted and the players needed to pull up their socks. "It boils down to the mind-set of the players," said Kannemeyer. "Sundowns still have the strongest squad in the PSL or maybe even on the continent. "What more can Pitso do? He can't put the ball in the net. But they are Sundowns and will bounce back in no time. It's just that the loss in the Champions League and then Chiefs was a big blow." Attention turns to the Telkom Knockout this weekend. Champions Cape Town City will begin their title defence against Baroka at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday.
