Zambia said it expected a new outbreak of armyworms in the 2017/18 crop season, after the maize-munching pests ravaged Southern Africa earlier this year. Countries with confirmed outbreaks can face import bans on agricultural products as the armyworm is classified as a quarantine pest. The pest can also cause extensive damage to crops and has a preference for maize, the regional staple. Zambia Communications and Transport Minister Brian Mushimba, who is in charge of the department of meteorology, said in a statement that Zambia expected an outbreak of armyworms nationwide during the crop season that runs from October to March.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads "We are working with the ministry of agriculture to ensure that the armyworms are fought," Mushimba said. During the 2016/2017 season, crop production was threatened by an outbreak of armyworms but Zambia still managed to reap 3.6-million tonnes of maize, up from 2.8-million the previous year, after containing the pests. Mushimba said in the forecast that Zambia would experience normal to above-normal rainfall in the 2017/2018 crop season, with flash floods in some areas. Outbreaks of the pest erupted in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and South Africa. They followed an El Nino-triggered drought, which hit crops, leaving millions in need of food aid.
