Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic is not pressing the panic buttons yet even after four games without a win. It all started with a 1-0 loss to Bidvest Wits last month, followed by three consecutive draws with Polokwane City (2-2), Platinum Stars (1-1) and a goalless draw with nemesis Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Sredojevic actually had a plan from the beginning of the season. He broke down the season into six sets of five games each, aiming to get at least 10 points from each set - they got 11 from the first one. They've got just three points from four games in the second set, with one more match to play, so clearly things have not been working to plan, but the Serbian is not a worried man.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads "There are many teams that have the ambition to be on top of this league," he sighed. "I know all the teams intending to be on top of the league are having a plan of 10 to 12 points per set. Yes, we got 11 points from the first set and later on we entered into something [not getting the results]." The 48-year-old knows where his team is falling short and believes they will get it right down the line. "We have no problem of performance and no problem of creating [chances], but we have a problem of converting. We shall reclaim what we have lost in the [second] set," he said. Pirates face Golden Arrows away in their next match - a Telkom Knockout last-16 clash on Saturday, before resuming league action.
