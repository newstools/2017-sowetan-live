Stormers flyhalf Jean-Luc du Plessis has been ruled out of rugby for between four to six weeks after sustaining a stress injury on the pelvis.Du Plessis missed last weekend s 41-10 win over the Southern Kings with what was diagnosed as a groin strain.But further scans revealed the injury to the pelvis which was complicating his groin recovery. The 22-year-old s misfortune opens the door for 18-year-old sensation Damian Willemse to have a longer than expected run in the first team squad. But Robert du Preez who started against the Kings looks set to retain his place while Du Plessis recovers with Kurt Coleman and Willemse vying for the back-up flyhalf berth. - TMG Digital
