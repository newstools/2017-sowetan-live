EFF leader Julius Malema will honour the late struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada's wish for him to visit Robben Island.It was revealed at Kathrada's funeral on Wednesday that the struggle stalwart wanted to personally take Malema to the island where he and many other anti-apartheid activists were held captive."One of the last things Ahmed Kathrada wanted me to organise last year, comrade Malema, he wanted to take you to Robben Island. He pressed us to organise this thing, unfortunately the communication didn't work out," Neeshan Balton, the Executive Director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation told Malema at the funeral service.Speaking to Imaan Rapeti on Power FM, Malema said he will be going to Robben Island on Kathrada's birthday.He revealed that he spoke to the Kathrada's wife Barbara Hogan and came to a conclusion to visit the island on the stalwart's birthday in August.The visit to Robben Island in August will be Malema's first after he told the radio station that he has never gone because the place did not make him "feel comfortable".Malema received a special mention at the funeral by the Kathrada Foundation before the stalwart was laid to rest.
