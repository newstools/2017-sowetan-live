The African Union and South Sudan are failing in their joint responsibility to set up a court to prosecute atrocities in the central African country and are not cooperating with a United Nations inquiry, a U.N. investigator said on Tuesday."There is no reason to think that a robust hybrid court will be set up any time soon by the African Union, if ever. Indeed some senior officials have told us that it will never happen," Kenneth Scott, a member of the U.N. commission on human rights in South Sudan, told the Human Rights Council in Geneva."We ve requested the draft documents that we understand exist a draft statute, a draft memorandum of understanding but they have declined to provide it to the commission."
