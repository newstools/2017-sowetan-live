Amajita had taken the lead in the sixth minute via Liam Jordan, when he was teed-up by Sipho Mbule, only for Katlego Mohamme to bring Guinea level with a wicked own-goal.The game started off on a high tempo yesterday.After both teams scored, the pace of the game slowed down.The second stanza's first chance fell to Jordan in the 47th minute but his shot was blocked by Guinea's defence.On the hour-mark Mandjou Diallo's charges shouted for a penalty when Sanele Tshabalala brought down Daouda Camara inside the box but the referee waved play on.The west Africans eventually got a penalty to seal the victory after Tercious Malepe handled inside the box. Bangoura made no mistake from the spot-kick. Amajita return home today.
