Palazzolo was called as a witness. At the time Mr Palazzolo did not know that I was investigating him. It was only after a meeting with (the two senior police officers) that he was convinced that I was investigating him and that he changed his testimony said Lincoln.Thereafter said Lincoln Palazzolo and high-level policemen met with Thabo Mbeki who was the deputy president at the time. In addition to reporting to Mandela Lincoln and the special unit also reported to Mbeki.Palazzolo demanded that Lincoln resign from the SAPS. In return Palazzolo told Mbeki he promised to not testify against Lincoln.Lincoln said one of the officers Leonard Knipe told Mbeki that he would drop charges against Lincoln if he resigned from the SAPS.Palazzolo is incarcerated in Italy after evading authorities there for many years.Lincoln was convicted on various counts of fraud relating to irregular expenditure in the use of his car in covert operations. He was sentenced but fought until the conviction was overturned and he was reinstated into the SAPS. TMG Digital
