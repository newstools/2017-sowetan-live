A top Limpopo municipal manager and her boyfriend face a probe by the South African Reserve Bank for allegedly operating a multimillion-rand pyramid scheme that swindled people of their money.Lepelle Nkumpi municipality's executive manager Lovey Modiba and her boyfriend Ronald Tshikororo allegedly operated a travel scheme that promised people huge returns, car rentals and overseas trips if they deposited money into the couple's bank accounts.The company was modelled on the Indian Travel Venture International (TVI) Express.Scores of people allegedly deposited between R100 and R57000 from 2011 to 2012.The matter was reported by two individuals who invested in the scheme but couldn't get a single cent out of it.A letter written by Bowman Law attorney, Francois Trichardt and seen by the Sowetan, reads: "You should ascertain that the amount of money you obtained unlawfully is R6847500."Modiba confirmed running the scheme but insisted she did not intentionally swindle people of their money."I opened a business account as an administrator but I didn't personally benefit from the R6-million."I have proposed to the Reserve Bank to settle R600000 which I personally benefited," she said.She said she stopped operating the scheme in 2012 after she heard that TVI was a fraud.Trichardt refused to comment and referred the queries to the Reserve Bank (SARB).SARB spokesman Jabulani Sikhakhane said: "The bank does not comment on matters of individuals regarding investigations we may have."ramothwalap@sowetan.co.za
