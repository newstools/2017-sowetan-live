They were arrested during an operation conducted by a security company and the Hawks.Initially the miners were facing 843 charges. However they were cleared of 266 charges and were found guilty on 577 charges last month.The charges included racketeering money laundering and contravention of the Precious Metals Act. They were also charged for trespassing as well as theft of more than R120 million.Hawks boss Lieutenant-General Mthandazo Ntlemeza hailed the sentence as a landmark moment in the fight against illegal mining in the country. We hope that this precedent set by our courts will not only serve as a deterrent but will also help us in our efforts to combat illegal mining even in other upcoming cases said Ntlemeza.
