Orlando Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret says a loss against Kaizer Chiefs could have been a huge setback, but he can now focus on the positive aspects of the 1-1 draw at the weekend.The two sides had to settle for a point each in what many agree was an entertaining Soweto Derby.Amakhosi went ahead through Joseph Molangoane early in the first half, but Jonevret's men found the equaliser when Tsepo Masilela scored an own goal.And while Jonevret's counterpart, Steve Komphela, expressed disappointment at not winning considering Chiefs had Willard Katsande's penalty kick saved by Brighton Mhlongo, the Swede felt avoiding defeat augurs well for the Buccaneers."A draw is okay, but we wanted to win," said Jonevret, who admitted that Amakhosi were the better side in the second half.The 54-year-old was in charge of his second official match, having also drawn the first one 1-1 against Polokwane City.Jonevret believes his squad is growing in confidence and they may be winless in 11 matches in all competitions, but he's happy to see many of his players show that they are returning to form - especially captain Oupa Manyisa."I haven't seen all the players in a game situation, but Oupa for example, was out of form for a very long time after his injury. But I think everybody who saw the game can see he's really on his way to the top again. He's a really good footballer and the same with [Abbubaker] Mobara I think," said Jonevret.Mhlongo, who denied Molangoane a brace minutes after Chiefs had taken the lead in the 16th minute, also stood out. He emerged as the hero as he stopped Katsande's penalty with five minutes of regulation time remaining.Winger Thembinkosi Lorch also appears to have finally settled into the team and it was his attempt that came off Masilela for the own goal.Pirates, meanwhile, will host SuperSport United at Orlando Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm) and Jonevret is hoping for some consistency.
