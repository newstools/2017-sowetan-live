A R1-million per month carrot has been dangled in front of Stuart Baxter by the SA Football Association, prompting him to consider returning to the Bafana Bafana hot-seat, Sowetan has established.Baxter is still contracted to SuperSport United but will hold talks with Safa this weekend, following United's Absa Premiership match against Baroka tomorrow."Yes we have been approached by Safa with regard to the services [of Baxter]. We agreed to meet them after the Baroka game," said Steve Kapulschnik, Baxter's agent.He would not dwell on details of the Safa approach. But Sowetan has established, through an independent source, that Baxter was swayed by the financial offer made by the association."Safa told him he'll be paid R1-million a month, and it's difficult for SuperSport to counter that," said our source, who cannot be named because he is not mandated to speak on the issue.It's also understood that SuperSport chief executive Stan Matthews told the players to prepare for life without Baxter.Matthews confirmed that SuperSport had given Baxter seven days to conclude a deal with Safa, although he would join Bafana only in July."He still has 15 months and a three-year option remaining, so it's up to the parties to see how to settle this," Matthews told Sowetan.Safa, meanwhile, refused to comment on the issue, with spokesman Dominic Chimhavi saying a statement would be released today.Baxter's imminent return should bring to an end Safa's three-month search for a Bafana coach following the sacking of Shakes Mashaba in December.But whether he's the answer to Bafana's ills remains to be seen, not least as his first mission with the national side ended with a failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.However, the Briton has had great success since returning to South Africa in 2012, winning two league titles with Kaizer Chiefs and the Nedbank Cup with both Amakhosi and SuperSport.But scrambling for him now would appear an act of desperation by Safa, who have missed several deadlines to hire a new Bafana coach.
