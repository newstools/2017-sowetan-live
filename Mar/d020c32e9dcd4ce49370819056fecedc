Mamelodi Sundowns can score form anywhere Kaizer Chiefs left-back Tsepo Masilela has admitted ahead of Saturday s big match-up at FNB Stadium.The former Getafe defender and ex-Bafana Bafana veteran played down mischievous assertions by Downs coach Pitso Mosimane that Chiefs are favourites in the Absa Premiership showdown and admitted Downs are dangerous in front of goal from all positions. They ve got goals everywhere. Percy Tau scores Themba Zwane scores KK [Hlompo Kekana] scores they ve got Leonardo Castro back. Thapelo Morena when he plays more attacking scores. So they ve got goals everywhere. It s not a team where you can say you ll only plan for this player or that This is the man to watch . So if you lose concentration you will get punished playing against such opposition. You can t relax and take things easy or try to cut corners. We have to be professional about our business and do the right things. Fourth-placed Chiefs on 36 points from 21 games are playing to remain serious contenders in the title race.Title favourites Sundowns have dropped seven points in the last three games two draws and a defeat and need victory to potentially eliminate a league contender and get their game of points catch-up back on track.The fifth-placed Brazilians have 34 points from 17 matches.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
