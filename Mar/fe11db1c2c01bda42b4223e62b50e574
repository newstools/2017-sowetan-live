Stuart Baxter faces a tough choice over the next days as he considers his line-up for SuperSport United s key Premier Soccer League encounter against Ajax Cape Town at home in Atteridgeville on Saturday.The return of Ronwen Williams from a lower back injury means that the SuperSport United boss must make a difficult choice between the Bafana Bafana No. 2 and Reyaad Pieterse who has been filling in.Williams played in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge at the weekend for SuperSport s academy to prove his fitness and has been back in training with the first team squad for a fortnight now.The 25-year-old last played for the club in November against Baroka after which he was injured.Pieterse who joined from Kaizer Chiefs before the start of the season took over from Williams making his debut in a 1-1 draw against his old club in November and going on to play in goal in the Telkom Knockout final just weeks later which SuperSport lost to Cape Town City.Pieterse also 25 has now played nine successive league games conceding six goals.Williams played in the first nine league matches of the season conceding five goals.Pieterse has done little wrong to lose his place and as incumbent of the No. 1 jersey at the club must be feeling he can hold onto the position especially as Baxter has long been a coach advocating consistency in team selection.But Williams undoubted shot-stopping talent makes him among the country s best only second to Itumeleng Khune in the Bafana Bafana pecking order.It means a tough day or two for Baxter as he deliberates before the choosing his team to take on Ajax. - TMG Digital
