We have had an unbelievable season despite the injuries that we had " he said."Expectation will be there but I have told the players to give everything they have."We have put ourselves in a position of favourites and one of the candidates."The players must not let this current success go to their heads but they must give everything that they have to the cause. If we do that we will be able to deal with the high expectations which is growing because we were not among the favourites at the beginning of the season."We must put our feet on the ground and continue to do the work. For United to go all the way and win the league title they must fend off other contenders like Cape Town City Bidvest Wits Kaizer Chiefs and a Sundowns side that has three games in hand. I don t worry about Sundowns because I can t control what they are going to do in their next matches " Baxter said."I am not really interested in what they (Sundonwns) do in their games."They have games in hand but those games may affect them."We are top of the log we are candidates with things in our hands and we can perform to the level that put us in the mix. Speaking about Ajax Baxter admitted that though they are sitting on the wrong side of the table they have what it take to win the encounter because there are no easy team in the league. They are a good and talented team which means that we must play well against them."There are no easy games out there."I am waiting for someone to say to me that there is an easy team in the league and point it out to me."Against Ajax I don t expect to win and I don t expect to lose he said. - TMG Digital
