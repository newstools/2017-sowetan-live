Lwazi Mvovo spent much of his 100th Super Rugby match against the Reds last week hovering on the touchline and not getting much ball. With another start for him for Saturday's clash against the Brumbies in Canberra Mvovo hopes there will be better pickings for him and the Sharks. It was the first game of the season and we didn't get the win " Mvovo said."We did the work and we now just have to move on from the Reds game."The Reds were a quality side but we made a couple of mistakes and those ended up costing us the game."If we can just fix those mistakes from that fixture we'll be well off because we're looking forward to the next game. The Sharks do not have a good record against the Brumbies away and Mvovo is one of five survivors from the Jake White-coached side that lost 16-9 in 2014.Mvovo is the only survivor from the 2012 finalists that beat the Brumbies 29-26 where he scored a long range try.That win was one of only two Sharks victories in Canberra with the other one being the 41-23 triumph in 1998.With an even younger team than the grizzled sides that bested the two-time Super Rugby champions on their own turf Mvovo said the Brumbies will be smarting from their 17-13 defeat to the Crusaders in Christchurch.Coach Robert du Preez has made two changes to the side that lost in Brisbane with Stephan Lewies replacing the suspended Etienne Oosthuizen and former French international Clement Poitrenaud coming in for Curwin Bosch who moves to the bench.Brumbies coach Stephen Larkham has kept faith with the same starting 23 that lost in the South Island city. The Brumbies are a quality side and they played very well against the Crusaders."They're not going to be an easy side to play against."They play with a lot of ball carriers in the backline."However it's all going to be about what we're going to do and our game plans and we'll plan accordingly Mvovo said. We have a plan for this tour and we have to win this game."But it's all about us getting our plans right for the game and getting over the little hurdle we had in the first game."We need to end the tour on a good note.
