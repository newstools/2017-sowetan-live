I have been a loyal reader of Sowetan ... I think pretty much for half of my life.I remember I started reading it from my high school days.I have been in the entertainment industry for the past 15 years, and Sowetan remains one of the newspapers that I read daily.My favourite day to buy and read Sowetan is Friday.My favourite section has always been the Time Out section. I also enjoy reading entertainment stories, and I like the Gig Guide too.The other good sections I really enjoy are the obituary pages, Page 3 and sports.I think Sowetan is not fully utilising the internet, I see a missed opportunity there, you need to merge your print and digital editions.I saw the new look of Sunday World, your sister newspaper, and I know a lot of people were confused, asking if it is still the same newspaper, but I think now a lot of people are starting to get used to the new look.Coming back to Sowetan, if the newspaper is going to change, don't make the logo too different from what we are ordinarily used to.I think it is good to re-launch, but the paper should not be totally different.Sowetan needs to also cover stories that will help people who are looking for jobs.The sports coverage is handled well, especially horse racing, which is still relevant for many readers.We also want to see more on entrepreneurs - there should be stories on those that have made it, on those who want to make it , and also on opportunities for entrepreneurship.I like your front pages, specifically the page item you call a puff, where you place pictures of beautiful ladies - it is a very attractive page element.Page 3 is popular and I am looking forward to the new-look Sowetan and wishing you all the best with the re-launch.I think it is safe to say that Sowetan will continue to be one of my favourite newspapers.
