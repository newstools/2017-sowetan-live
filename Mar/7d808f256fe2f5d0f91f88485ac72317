Fighting to remove themselves from the relegation battle remains the only priority for Ajax Cape Town this season despite progressing six points clear of the drop zone says their coach Stanley Menzo.Ajax sit in 11th place in the Premier Soccer League standings on 20 points a far cry from the two points they had when the former Dutch national team goalkeeper took over from Roger de Sa in October.Ajax are now just three points away from a potential top eight place as they prepare to take on high-flying SuperSport United in Atteridgeville on Saturday.But Menzo said there could be no talk at the club of a top eight target just yet. We can t be speaking about the top eight because we are just two defeats away from dropping back to the relegation places. We are a long way still from safety and by no ways anywhere near the top eight yet he said. Points have been very precious for us this season and that is why we cherish the points we have got against Polokwane City and Kaizer Chiefs in our last two matches Those were points we hadn t counted on. Ajax are still looking for their first win this year but have played against top six opposition. I d like to have one or two more points Menzo said. - TMG Digital
