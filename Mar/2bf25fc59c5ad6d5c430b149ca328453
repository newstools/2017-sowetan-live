Dharamsala - India thrashed Australia by eight wickets yesterday to seal a test series marked by outbursts and controversies 2-1 and underline their status as the world's number one side.Chasing 106 on the penultimate day of the fourth test, opener Lokesh Rahul hit 51 not out in Dharamsala as India took the Border-Gavaskar trophy back from Australia.India's stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane (38 not out) hit two sixes in a row off Pat Cummins en route to the comprehensive win, as fans waved giant India flags and danced.Skipper Virat Kohli, who was forced to sit out the final test with a shoulder injury, said the hard-fought win over Australia was the most satisfying of the recent run."Unbelievable. This is the best series win so far," said Kohli, who received the test mace on behalf of India for ending the season as the world's top side."The way the Australian team gave us a fight was really amazing, but the way the guys kept bouncing back showed the true character of the side."Australia captain Steve Smith apologised for letting emotion get the better of him. On Monday, footage indicated he called Murali Vijay a "cheat" for wrongly claiming a catch."I have been pretty intense throughout this series. I really wanted to do well for the team. At times I have been in my own bubble and have let my emotions slip. I apologise for that," said Smith.In the maiden test played in Dharamsala, India scored 332 in their first innings in reply to Australia's 300, before the tourists collapsed for 137.
