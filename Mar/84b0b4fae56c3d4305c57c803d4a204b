In our last game we played very well in the first half and managed to score two quick goals we intend to continue from there but today we expect our boys to stay focused in both halves " said Senong."We have also warned them about conceding fouls in dangerous areas of the pitch and to keep shape all the time. We have the opportunity to add our names in the history books this afternoon and we are just 90 minutes from realizing that dream."We all know we could have wrapped it up in the previous match but it was not to be and it is all in the past now."We strongly believe in the talent we have at our disposal and we are confident they will deliver this is perhaps the most important match of our careers and we intend to make it count.
