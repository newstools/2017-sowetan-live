Kaizer Chiefs are the favourites in Saturday night s huge Absa Premiership game Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane proclaimed in what must surely have been a beginning of the mind-games ahead of the match at FNB Stadium.Mosimane pointed to Chiefs recent form having gone 10 matches unbeaten in the all competitions though the statement from the coach of the current African champions might still be taken as somewhat outrageous in many quarters.Sundowns have lost once domestically in 11 league and cup matches.Fifth-placed Sundowns on 34 points from 17 games have to continue reeling in the PSL leading teams as they whittle down the number of games they have had to catch up from winning the Caf Champions League and playing in the Fifa Club World Cup last year.Chiefs on 36 points from 21 matches can deal a blow to formidable favourites Downs while a defeat can truly leave Amakhosi s title chances floundering. It s a big game we re playing Kaizer Chiefs. And to make it worse we re playing at FNB Stadium Mosimane pronounced after winning the PSL s coach of the month award for February at the league s offices in Parktown this week. But all that s important is to try and get three points and it s not going to be easy because at this point in time we are the underdogs. Because Chiefs have had a very good run comparatively in their league games this year. So they have an advantage in that space. But you know how football is. It s what happens on the day. So we will tread carefully. We will respect the game. Ja it s not going to be easy but we will tray and do our best as usual. Downs beat Chiefs 2-1 in the corresponding first round fixture at Loftus Versfeld in November. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
