Polokwane City striker Thobani Mncwango is in hot water at the club. Sowetan has established that Mncwango is out in the cold and it would appear that the problem arose when he made comments about Orlando Pirates being after his services."The whole thing came across as if he's not happy here at the club," revealed a source from Polokwane City."It all came out as if the club blocked his move to Pirates, because he said they [Pirates] called him and yet the move didn't happen."The interview was published three weeks ago by a local publication and on that day, February 8, Mncwango was allowed to play against Maritzburg United as the two sides settled for a 1-all draw in Polokwane."He was suspended immediately after our game against Maritz burg United," continued the source."The chairman mentioned in the dressing room that someone was going to be suspended, but didn't say why.We later found out that Thobani was the player being suspended and the reason was that he spoke bad about the team in the media. For now, he's not allowed to train with the team but he has to report for duty and just watches training. It is a bad situation for him."Mncwango took our call yesterday when we called for his side of the story and said we should give him half an hour because he was busy, but never answered his phone again.The player has missed the matches against Highlands Park, Ajax Cape Town and Orlando Pirates, which all finished 1-1.Rise and Shine coach Luc Eymael admitted after the Pirates match that their matches have been affected by Mncwango's absence."We again missed Thobani and that is three games without him playing and it is difficult for us, but you have to ask the chairman [Johnny Mogaladi]. I can't talk about that but it's difficult."It is not clear when the player will appear before the club's disciplinary committee.
