Sharks centre Andre Esterhuizen seems to be enjoying life with new and talented players alongside him even though he is rueing another injury-enforced absence for Patrick Lambie. It means the burly inside centre has to get used to another pivot even though that seems to be business as usual for him because of the frequency of Lambie's injuries. We all feel for Pat and what happened to him wasn't good " he said."That's been the case for the past three seasons where he's been suffering from injury after injury."I said if the kind of injuries that Pat has been having happened to me I would have long quit rugby."He's a stronger person than me but I'm sure he'll bounce back."He's always found a way to bounce back Esterhuizen said. He's very strong mentally and he's always come back as a stronger person and I think he'll come back in that manner."We wish him a speedy recovery. Lambie's absence will allow for the young and exciting Curwin Bosch to settle alongside Esterhuizen with an easy outing expected against the Southern Kings on Saturday evening.It is a game that will also see Esterhuizen's centre partner Lukhanyo Am up against his old team mates.For a player who started out his Super Rugby career at a young age Esterhuizen understands the pressures Bosch will face especially in South African Super Rugby derbies.They will form the backbone of the matches the Sharks have over the next month with a trip to Bloemfontein to face the Cheetahs on March 25 being followed a visit to Johannesburg where the Lions will be waiting on April Fool's day. All the flyhalves we have here are young I think they're Under-21 but it's a big position for the youngsters."When you lose someone like Pat you only notice his absence when he's gone with all the institutional knowledge that he has."It's a big role to fill for them but we'll see if they're up for it Esterhuizen. This week's going to be better because it's going to be my first week with them but I'm very confident that Bosch will do the job."He's got a good rugby head and he's not scared to tackle. - TMG Digital
