Phakamani Mahlambi believes he and Luther Singh can convey their experiences gained being part of the Bafana Bafana squad to their Amajita teammates ahead of the U-20 World Cup especially if they get a run in Tuesday night s game against Angola.Mahlambi and Singh are the two teenagers in the Bafana squad for their two current friendlies where South Africa beat Guinea-Bissau 3-1 at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday and face Angola at a sold-out Buffalo City Stadium in East London on Tuesday night.Both played a role for Amajita finishing fourth at the U-20 Africa Cup of Nations in Zambia this month which saw SA also qualify for the Fifa U-20 World Cup in South Korea in May and June. I am hoping to get a run (against Angola) because the coach had said there will be a rotation of players Bidvest Wits tearaway forward Mahlambi said. And should I get the nod I will grab the opportunity with both hands and do the best for my country. Obviously I want to test my readiness for the Senior Team and I have to thank the technical team for selecting me. It s an honour for me and Luther to come and play alongside the big names in South African football and for us this is a motivation. We are going to play the U-20 World Cup and for us being in the Bafana Bafana squad is a learning period where we need to get some experience to transfer to the U-20 squad because we want to win that tournament and not make up the numbers. Bafana s four injured players Mulomowandau Mathoho (skin abrasion) Thulani Hlatshwayo (ankle) Dean Furman (groin) and Andile Jali (shoulder dislocation) were to assessed at Monday night s final training session.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
