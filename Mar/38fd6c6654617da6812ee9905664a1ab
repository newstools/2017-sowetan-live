No one wanted to be considered a favourite, as both Steve Komphela and Pitso Mosimane claimed they are underdogs heading into tomorrow's epic Absa Premiership clash at FNB Stadium (8.15pm).Mamelodi Sundowns coach Mosimane first claimed they were the underdogs because Chiefs have had a better run in the league, which includes five straight wins between December and February, but Komphela quickly begged to differ. Both clubs are without a victory in their last three league matches.Komphela, though, has every right to claim he is an underdog. Since joining Amakhosi, the coach has not beaten Mosimane, struggling to outclass a man who has been praised for his tactical nous."We are the underdogs because Chiefs have been doing better than us if you check the last eight games. "We envy them and wish we could win five matches in a row," said Mosimane."We've drawn two matches and lost one, so we are not in a good space. Also, their medical room is empty, so that's one of the things that make us not to be in a good space."Chiefs have fresher legs [after the international break], so it's not the right time to play them."In his response, Komphela said he will not allow Mosimane to claim the underdog tag. Even though he has not beaten Mosimane since taking over at Chiefs, Komphela said he was not the type to seek revenge. "Underdog? I beg to differ. Underdog in what sense? I don't think you could get carried away and say they are underdogs. It's a dangerous tag because fortune sometimes favours the underdog. Maybe he [Mosimane] is seeking divine intervention and I am not going to allow him to do that," said Komphela."We will give them the respect they deserve. I foresee a tight match."
