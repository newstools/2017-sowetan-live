This is painful to all of us but unfortunately it's beyond our control. He felt the pain in his chest on Sunday in training and went to see a doctor. I spoke to him and he told me about the pain but after an hour I heard that his condition became serious and was taken to hospital. I think it's something to do with his heart but I'm not sure but it's got to do with a heart condition he said. We are so sad and shocked by this but we can't control God's will. We wish him a speedy recovery. The animated coach who hardly ever sits down for the entire 90 minutes fell ill just days after his side went down 2-1 against Platinum Stars on Friday night.Assistant coach Mbuyiselo Sambu will be in charge of the team in tomorrow's PSL game against Wits.- TMG Digital/DispatchLIVE
