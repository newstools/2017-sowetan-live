Bidvest Wits winger Daine Klate says everyone is pulling in the same direction at the club, and this augurs well for their league title ambitions.The Clever Boys have finished in the top three over the past three seasons, but indications are that they may go all the way this season.As the club's head coach Gavin Hunt puts it: "You are as strong as your bench."And Klate, who was with Hunt at SuperSport United where they won three consecutive league titles a few seasons ago, believes Wits are stronger this season."That's how teams win championships. It's not only the 11 [who start]. The 11 will give you a lot during the season, but there is the question of the bench," Klate told Sowetan."When I won league titles, it has always been about that. When the chips are down, there are players that will come in and make a difference."That's what we had at SuperSport when we won the [three] league titles."We had [Katlego] Mashego and one day we were 1-0 down against Moroka Swallows [in 2008], and after coming on at half-time, he scored four goals in the second half and we won 4-2."We had Mark Mayambela at [Orlando] Pirates and he used to come in for 20/30 minutes and change the complexion of the game."We were 2-0 down against Wits [in 2011] and we won 3-2. We went on to win the league," Klate added.Wits host Platinum Stars this weekend.If Wits win the league, Klate will become the first player to win the title six times in the PSL era (since 1996).As it stands, Klate shares that honour with Michael Manzini, ex-Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns left-back David Kannemeyer, who are all on five.Andre Arendse also has five league titles to his name but one came in 1995, before the PSL started.
