SA football Association (Safa) has Africa Cup of Nations winning coaches Herve Renard and Hugo Broos to pick from for the vacant Bafana Bafana coaching post.Weekend media reports quoted a Safa source saying the man who was shoo-in for the job - Carlos Quieroz - was now out of the reckoning.The source cited Quieroz's ?7-million (about R97-million) resignation clause from his Iran coaching job as a snag.Renard, 48, and Broos, 64, have apparently written to Safa indicating their interest in succeeding Shakes Mashaba, who was sacked in December.Queiroz, 64, was close to being unveiled by Safa last week but the announcement was postponed to this week.Safa tweeted that the new coach was not available for a press conference when the announcement was expected.Queiroz had agreed to return to the job he held between 2000 and 2002 following his recommendation by the Safa technical committee.However, two-time Afcon champion Renard has now been tipped as an overwhelming favourite to replace Mashaba. - Sowetan Reporter
