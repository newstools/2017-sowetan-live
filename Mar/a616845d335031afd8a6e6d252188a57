Cape Town City coach Eric Tinkler says they will have every right to consider themselves legitimate title candidates if they beat champions Mamelodi Sundowns in Friday night s top-of-the-table clash at the Athlone Stadium. In my mind if we can collect three points against Sundowns then we can consider ourselves as potential league winners " he said on Wednesday. I think that s the magnitude of the game."I think it would be a good result for us if we could get a win against them. Yes we have managed to beat them in the league before but they have pushed on and made a few new signings who have been good signings.City are one of only two teams to have handed Sundowns defeat in the Premier Soccer League this season winning 2-1 away at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria in October.The brand new Cape outfit share top place in the standings with SuperSport United on 35 points two more than Sundowns who have played three fewer games. It s a game where we want to collect three points."I think prior to our game against Baroka we were disappointed by our draw against Pirates and felt we lost two points there."The Baroka game was extremely important to collect those points ahead of this match which is going to be extremely tough. Sundowns have so much depth that we must approach the game mentally strong first and foremost."Whatever (Sundowns) team that comes out on that field is going to be quality."He has got practically three different starting XIs that most clubs in the country would dream of having. But are they beatable? Yes."And the reality for us is that we have nothing to lose."We have no pressure. Nobody expected us to be where we are."We need to just go out there and play the football we know we are capable of playing and enjoy the occasion Tinkler added. - TMG Digital
