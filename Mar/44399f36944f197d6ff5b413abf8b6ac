Bafana Bafana caretaker-coach Owen Da Gama said he had not contacted Kamohelo Mokotjo to determine the midfielder s availability yet despite naming the player in a squad for two friendlies this month.Mokotjo was handed a Bafana recall on Thursday by Da Gama for the friendlies the coach will take charge of against Guinea-Bissau in Durban on March 25 and Angola at a venue to be announced on March 28.The FC Twente star had become estranged from the national team and its previous coach Ephraim Shakes Mashaba who was sacked in late December and declared himself unavailable for national duty.Da Gama said he was also not aware of complications that might arise from Mokotjo having this year gained his Dutch citizenship which might require processes for the player to retain his dual South African citizenship and Bafana eligibility. To be honest with you I was not aware of his nationality. I don t know anything about that Da Gama said announcing his squad at Safa House in Nasrec. What we ve done is put the list together put it in front of the team manager [Barney Kujane] and I m sure the manager is going to look into that. Da Gama said he had not contacted Mokotjo to establish whether the player would be available for the friendlies.The coach appears to have had the intention of naming the player then leaving the ball in his court. To be honest with you again I have not been in contact with him. I was hoping that we release it to the public and then we would certainly work on him the caretaker-coach said. But I believe that we must do everything in our powers to try and get these players back playing for Bafana Bafana. One player who does not seem to have an issue with a return to the SA set-up having also become estranged with Mashaba is Lens striker Kermit Erasmus whom Da Gama also recalled.Judging by a tweet on Erasmus s official Twitter page that read: Im Back #BafanaBafana the former Orlando Pirates forward appeared pleased by his recall.With the SA Football Association yet to name a new head coach Da Gama will take charge of this month s friendlies. - TMG Digital
