Focus will be on returning Proteas limited overs players when the Cobras host the Dolphins in a Momentum One Day Cup clash at Boland Park in Paarl on Wednesday afternoon.The Cobras have been boosted by fast bowler Dane Peterson while the Dolphins welcome back all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo and spinner Imraan Tahir.The two were part of the South African squad that played against New Zealand in the 1-0 T20 and 3-2 ODI wins.The competition is entering the crucial second round phase and the Dolphins would go top of the standings and also put themselves in a good position for a semi-final spot if they beat their hosts in Cape Town.Looking ahead of Wednesday s clash Cobras captain Dane Piedt said Peterson returns to the team with boosted confidence and more experience. We are happy to have Peterson after he represented South Africa in New Zealand he said. We will definitely be fielding three seam bowlers."We must take care of lapses that undermine our effectiveness with bat or ball he added giving insight of how they are likely to line-up."What we need in the last five games is to do the basics well and execute our skills."We require even more clinical performances from all the players."We have a very experienced unit who knows what is needed to power the Cobras to a win against the Dolphins. However the Cobras have lost experienced fast bowler Vernon Philander to the Proteas Test squad.For Dolphins coach Grant Morgan the availability of the ICC ODI top ranked bowler Tahir and rising star Phehlukwayo could not have come at a better time. It is great to have the likes of Andile (Phehlukwayo) and Imran (Tahir) back in our attack."They have been absolute world-beaters for the Proteas and it will be good to have them back in the mix going forward in the Momentum One Day Cup."With them and Cameron Delport also back in the mix it s definitely one of the strongest squads we could assemble said Morgan who has lost spinner Keshav Maharaj to the Test squad.Elsewhere Titans coach Mark Boucher welcomes back batsman Farhaan Behardien and spinner Tabraiz Shamsi for the remainder of the competition which continues with a clash against the Knights at the Diamond Oval in Kimberley on Sunday.On the other hand the Titans have lost the services of wicket-keeper/batsman Heinrich Klaasen who has joined the Test side as cover to Quinton de Kock and experienced fast bowler Morne Morkel.The Lions have been hit hard by the departures of key batsmen Temba Bavuma and Stephen Cook and fast bowler Duane Olivier.They have linked up with the Test side while the Knights have also lost the services of batsman all-rounder Theunis de Bruyn.This Week s Momentum Cup Fixtures 8 March: Cobras v Dolphins (Boland Park Paarl) 10 March: Dolphins v Warriors (Kingsmead Durban); Lions v Cobras (Senwes Park Potchefstroom all matches 2pm) - TMG Digital
