Kaizer Chiefs out-of-favour midfielder Keagan Buchanan believes he still has a future at Naturena despite lack of game time.Buchanan joined Amakhosi from Bloemfontein Celtic in June last year. His arrival led many to suggest that he was recruited to fill the void left by Reneilwe Letsholonyane, who joined SuperSport United.However, it has not been a smooth ride for the 24-year-old, who has only registered two starts and three substitute appearances in the league this season."At the moment the team has got momentum, which makes it even tougher to break into the first team. I will have to wait for my opportunity because my future is here [at Chiefs]."I have been playing in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) team, which has prepared me well for first-team action."The reserve league is also as competitive as the Absa Premiership. In training I have been working hard because I want to play first-team football," Buchanan told Sowetan.He added: "When I joined Chiefs I was injured, and that made it difficult for me to hit the ground running."Now I am over my injury and looking forward to play my part to assist the club to challenge for the league title."
