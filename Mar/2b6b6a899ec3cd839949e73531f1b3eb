South Africans could go on yet another #PayBackTheMoney chant after nearly R120-million went down the drain in bidding costs for the 2022 Commonwealth Games.The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) officially pronounced yesterday that it had stripped Durban of the mega event due to a lack of financial guarantees from the South African government.Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) president Gideon Sam told Sowetan from London yesterday that the bidding costs was "the money we can't recover".According to its financial report, Sascoc spent R118-million bidding for the event."As a sports movement, we are disappointed but we have to accept the demands from a country that is in need of better housing, health and basic services," said Sam, who is also vice-president of the CGF.He said "the writing was on the wall the minute Minister Fikile Mbalula said there could be financial challenges to host the Games".He also revealed that the decision was taken on Saturdayto relinquish Durban the hosting rights.It emerged during a presentation by CGF, which included president Louise Martin, at an executive board meeting at the weekend that the CGF were unable to obtain the necessary financial guarantees from the government.Martin had earlier told the African membership at a summit in Rwanda that she was trying "to save" the Games for Africa, having travelled to South Africa last week to persuade President Jacob Zuma to back the event, which it has been estimated would have cost at least R8-billion to host.
