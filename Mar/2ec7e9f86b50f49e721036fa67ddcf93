The SA Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Sacci) has called on President Jacob Zuma to explain why he has called Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan back from an Invest SA roadshow and cancelled his deputy Mcebisi Jonas trip to the same event. No reasons have been put forward for what appears to be an unusual decision especially since the finance ministers are spear-heading the roadshow for promoting South Africa as an investment destination Sacci said in a statement issued on Monday afternoon. As business we are concerned about the uncertainty and the instability this will cause to the financial markets and to business confidence. We urge the Presidency to provide clear and cogent reasons to stabilise the markets as this continues to fuel speculation and innuendo and drives the narrative for the rumours on the capture of the National Treasury. We urge the President to give urgent clarity to this matter. It emerged earlier on Monday that Zuma had given instruction that Gordhan immediately return from London.Gordhan had only arrived there on Sunday accompanied by director general of treasury Lungisa Fuzile and other officials alongside head of Business Unity South Africa Jabu Mabuza and others.They were due to spend Monday in London talking to investors and the talks were due to continue on Tuesday.This was part of an investor tour which was scheduled to start in London and last for two days there and then proceed to Boston in the US for a day and New York for two days.The African National Congress earlier said it was not part of the decision to call back the finance minister and said it was never part of the national executive committee deliberations which took place over the weekend.The secretary general of the ruling party Gwede Mantashe however told reporters that the most senior leaders of the ANC were at Luthuli House for a meeting.
