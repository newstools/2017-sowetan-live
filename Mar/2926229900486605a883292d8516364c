There are three matches in the Absa Premiership on Tuesday night involving sides that are in African club competition at the weekend.Times Media Digital brings you a quick guide as to what to expect.PLATINUM STARS VS LAMONTVILLE GOLDEN ARROWSStars player to watch: Robert Ng ambi The evergreen Malawi international is showing some of his best form this season and is a threat in front of goal as well as a great organiser in the midfieldArrows player to watch: Knox Mutizwa The young Zimbabwean striker on loan from BidVest Wits is a raw talent but has shown an eye for goal and grabbed the winner last time out against Maritzburg United.Stars strengths/weaknesses: After a shaky first half to the season they have been very solid defensively and have just a single defeat in their last 10 games in all competitions.Arrows strengths/weaknesses: With just two clean-sheets in their last 11 matches Arrows have struggled to keep the opposition out and they will do well to keep an in-form Stars at bay in this one.Last meeting: Stars claimed a 1-0 away win when the teams last met in November with goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela grabbing the winner from the penalty-spot. Arrows finished the game with nine men after red cards for Kagisho Dikgacoi and Nkanyiso Mngwengwe.Quick fact: Stars lost six home games in a row in all competitions from August to December but since then their only defeat in five was to Mamelodi Sundowns (1-2). ORLANDO PIRATES VS SUPERSPORT UNITEDPirates player to watch: Brighton Mhlongo Mhlongo is likely to be busy in the Pirates goal and has blown hot and cold this season able to make outstanding stops but also prone to basic errors. How he handles the pressure will be key.United player to watch: Thabo Mnyamane Most of the SuperSport players are very direct and predictable in how they play but Mnyamane brings an x-factor that will be difficult for Pirates to defend against.Pirates strengths/weaknesses: Confidence is probably the major weakness at the moment as they gave a vastly improved display in the 1-1 Soweto Derby draw on Saturday. They should take positives from that clash but can they bring the same passion and desire into this game?United strengths/weaknesses: With an unbeaten league run of 18 matches SuperSport should be well ahead in the title race but too many of those games have been draws (nine) which shows an inability to kill teams off.Last meeting: It was the game that spelled the end for Pirates coach Muhsin Ertugral as SuperSport deservedly trailed 1-0 at halftime but then rallied to win 6-1 in one of the most spectacular collapses from a team ever seen in the PSL.Quick fact: Pirates 11-game winless streak is their longest in the PSL and there is every chance it will be extended to 12. But that is where it should end with the club to face third-tier EC Bees in the Nedbank Cup in the game after this one. CHIPPA UNITED VS BIDVEST WITSChippa player to watch: Thami Sangweni Controlling the midfield will be key in this game and Sangweni is up against some of the best in the top-flight. He has all the experience and quality to break up the play though.Wits player to watch: Buhle Mkhwanazi A threat at both ends of the pitch Mkhwanazi has been in excellent form this season and is a much under-rated player. His partnership with Thulani Hlatshwayo at centre-back is arguably the best in the PSL.Chippa strengths/weaknesses: Chippa have battled in the second half of games this season. Only three times have they been trailing at the break but have lost eight times in the league.Wits strengths/weaknesses: Only Sundowns have a better scoring record than Wits this season and their strength is that they can get goals from everywhere on the pitch. They do have only one win in six on the road in all competitions though.Last meeting: Wits edged the reverse fixture in November 1-0 thanks to a lone strike from Gabadinho Mhango but in truth should have won by a greater margin on the night.Quick fact: The game has been over-shadowed by the ill-health of coach Dan Malesela who was hospitalised on Sunday with chest pains.His two assistants Mbuyiselo Sambu and Zipho Dlangalala will take charge of the team for this game the second co-coaching unit in the PSL currently after Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka at Bloemfontein Celtic. - TMG Digital
