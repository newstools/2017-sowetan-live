The Pretoria high court is set to decide on the fate of the national traffic information system (eNatis) as the Road Traffic Management Corporation seeks an urgent order forcing former eNatis operator Tasima to hand over the system.The system is used to administer driver s and vehicle licence applications and renewals learner s licence bookings as well as notification of change of vehicle ownership and new vehicle registrations.A crisis looms as Telkom has threatened to shut the system if it does not receive payment today (March 24) which could spell chaos for the national traffic information system.RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said: The RTMC has approached the court on an urgent basis following a notice by Telkom that it intends to cut off the eNatis system if it does not receive payment today (March 24) he said.He said eNatis was dependent for its operation on services provided by Telkom and there will be a national crisis if Telkom were to implement its action as contained in a letter of demand given to Tasima. Tasima is unable to pay Telkom and other service providers. Neither the Department of Transport ( the DoT ) nor the RTMC are able to pay because any such payment would constitute irregular expenditure. RTMC can only make payment once Tasima has transferred the eNatis to the RTMC as ordered by the Constitutional Court Zwane said.In November last year the Constitutional Court declared that the extension of the contract in terms of which Tasima has operated the system since 2010 was invalid and ordered Tasima to hand over the system to RTMC within 30 days.However Tasima failed to comply with the court order.Zwane said the agency wants the court to order Tasima to vacate the premises from which is operates the eNatis as these premises are a national key point.It also seeks an order declaring that Tasima and its directors are in contempt of the Constitutional Court ruling instructing it to hand over the system.
