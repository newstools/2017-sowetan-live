World number one Andy Murray crashed out of the ATP Indian Wells Masters on Saturday, sent spinning in straight sets by Canadian qualifier Vasek Pospisil.Pospisil, ranked 129th in the world, triumphed 6-4, 7-6 (7/5), sealing the triumph on his fourth match point to delight a stadium court crowd won over by the underdog.For Britain s Murray, it was yet another disappointing performance in the California desert, where his best showing is a 2009 runner-up finish to Rafael Nadal.Last year Murray was bundled out in the third round, but he was hoping for much better as he arrived fresh off his 45th career ATP title in Dubai.Pospisil had never beaten Murray in four prior encounters. The 26-year-old, who defeated Taiwan s Lu Yen-Hsun in the first round as Murray enjoyed a bye, notched his fourth career victory over a top-10 player and his first since 2014.
