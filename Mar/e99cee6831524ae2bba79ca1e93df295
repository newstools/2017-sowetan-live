The abandoned Momentum One Day Cup qualifier match between the Knights and the Warriors at the Mangaung Oval in Bloemfontein on Sunday will be replayed from the beginning on Monday morning at the same venue.The match was stopped due to a dangerous pitch after eight overs following consultation between umpires Adrian Holdstock and Allahudien Paleker and home captain Pite van Biljon and his opposing counterpart Jon-Jon Smuts with Warriors on 88/3.Holdstock and Paleker also consulted with match referee Barry Lambson before they decided to stop the game and it will be the decision of the event technical committee what will happen should the pitch be still deemed dangerous on Monday.Warriors had won the toss and opted to bat first but found scoring extremely difficult, especially against the quicker bowlers.Knights bowler Dillon du Preez was their stand-out performer in his seven overs where he boasted impressive figures of 2/11 which included four maidens.His wickets included Jon-Jon Smuts, who took an uncharacteristic 36 balls for his 14 runs and Colin Ingram on seven.Gihahn Cloete was the other man to fall, when he was dismissed by Mbulelo Budaza (1/13), after taking 77 deliveries to make 30.The winner of this match will earn the right to meet the Titans in the final to be held at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Friday afternoon.TMG Digital
