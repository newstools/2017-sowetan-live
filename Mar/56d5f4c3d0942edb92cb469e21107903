The minister of social development and the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) want public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to oversee the implementation of an interim contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS).In their heads of argument filed at the Constitutional Court yesterday, Minister Bathabile Dlamini and Sassa asked the court to grant an order along the lines of the draft order."It [the draft order] provides that the public protector and the auditor-general [Kimi Makwetu], alternatively a person(s) or institution(s) directed by the court, jointly monitor the terms and implementation of the interim contract which Sassa intends to negotiate with [CPS]; a competitive bidding process aimed at the appointment by Sassa of a new contractor or contractors for the payment of social grants; and any steps taken by Sassa aimed at enabling Sassa itself to administer and pay the grants in future," the court document read in part.They said between March 1 and March 3, Sassa held negotiations with CPS, which have been stopped pending the approval of Treasury.Black Sash, a civil society organisation, lodged an urgent application for the court to have oversight over the proposed contract between Sassa and CPS. In 2014, the Constitutional Court found that the contract between Sassa and CPS was invalid.Department of Social Development spokeswoman Lumka Oliphant had said the tender to distribute social grants to 17million beneficiaries across the country was worth R10-billion a month."Those present [during negotiations] agreed in principle on the key elements of a new contract for an interim period between Sassa and CPS, which were subject to approval by the the minister [Dlamini] and the National Treasury," the papers read."The National Treasury must first grant approval for the deviation that Sassa will be seeking in order to negotiate with CPS..."The Minister and Sassa must file reports on affidavit with the court by . 22 March 2017, on the steps they have taken, the steps they will take . to ensure that the payment of all social grants is made when they fall due after 31 March 2017."
