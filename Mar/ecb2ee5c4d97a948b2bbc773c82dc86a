The Bulls have their backs against the wall with one win from four starts in Super Rugby so far this year and captain Adriaan Strauss says they will have to play with an attacking mindset against the Chiefs in Hamilton on Saturday.The Bulls have lost to the Stormers Cheetahs Blues and their only win came against the Sunwolves before their departure for New Zealand about two weeks ago.Speaking from New Zealand on Thursday morning after coach Nollis Marais announced five changes to the squad that lost to the Blues last weekend Strauss said they have to minimize mistakes. We are working hard every single week and we want to play with an attacking mindset against the Chiefs " he said."If we do the right things we will get it right and we need to hold on to the ball more which will help us to get more opportunities."To say that we are creating chances and not converting is the best assessment of where we are at the moment."This game is about creating pressure and making it count when it matters most. Marais pointed out that some of the mistakes they have committed have been their undoing and the players are fully aware of what to do going forward. In the match against the Blues there was miscommunication in the attack but we have worked on it and all the players know where to go and what to do."They took the loss against the Blues hard they know that things must be fixed but the team is in good space."We know that we must come out of this situation and perform. Nobody gives us a chance to beat the Chiefs because they are a side with lots of confidence."We know where we stand at the moment and we have won one out of four matches we believe that any team can beat any team in the competition at the moment."We just have to go out there and play. All their guys are back they are a good side that will punish you from everywhere if you make mistakes."They are a top New Zealand side at the moment but the guys are looking forward to it. In the changes that have been made Arno Botha will make his first appearance for the Bulls in the competition this season following on the eleven matches he played last year and 46 overall in his career.Botha comes in for injured Hanro Liebenberg at number eight Jesse Kriel moves from centre to fullback in place of Warrick Gelant who will play of the bench.Burger Odendaal is back in the run-on team and will start with Jan Serfontein in the midfield while at scrumhalf Rudy Paige replaces Piet van Zyl.Jacobie Adriaanse who missed out last weekend is back on the bench in the place of injured John-Roy Jenkinson while Jaco Visagie and Edgar Marutlulle also swops places with the latter on the bench. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
