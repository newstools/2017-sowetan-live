The ANC's Houghton branch in Johannesburg is banking on the prestige of some of its members, including two former presidents, to unseat the DA in an upcoming municipal by-election.The John Nkadimeng branch in the affluent suburb, which has former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe on its books, is hoping the duo's stature will help the party gain some lost ground. The by-election in Ward 73 which, includes Houghton and Norwood, comes after DA councillor Mia Snyman resigned in December.Branch secretary Stanley Letsoalo told Sowetan yesterday that there was much vested interest in the by-election."We are working on the ground 24/7," Letsoalo, who is also ANC ward candidate, said."It is an insult that this branch, which is in the back yard of former presidents, is governed by the DA," he said.Motlanthe, former Reserve Bank governor Tito Mboweni, poet Wally Serote and members of the Mandela family, are some of the high-profile figures who frequent the branch meetings. The branch also boasts senior ANC, government officials and business leaders as members. It has pinned its hopes on them to help wrestle power from the DA.DA Gauteng leader John Moodey said his party was going to retain the ward with a greater majority."We are not afraid, they must bring it on. They should be banking on the strength of their candidate not on the strength of past presidents."While the branch is banking on the fame of its prominent members, it is not certain Mbeki will be campaigning for it.He hasn't been seen at ANC election campaigns since his unceremonious removal as president of the country in 2008. This is despite several attempts by party head honchos to have him campaigning. Mbeki also seldom attends branch activities, according to branch officials. The branch supported Motlanthe in his failed bid to become the ANC president in Mangaung in 2012.
