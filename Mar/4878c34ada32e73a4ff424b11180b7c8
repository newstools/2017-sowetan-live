Auckland Blues flanker Steven Luatua has been suspended for four weeks for a head-high tackle during their weekend Super Rugby match against the Waikato Chiefs.The 15-Test All Black, who is moving to English club Bristol at the end of the Super season, was sent from the field just on half-time after he felled Chiefs wing Tim Nanai-Williams.Luatua tweeted a public apology after the game, won by the Chiefs 41-26, and pleaded guilty when he appeared before a disciplinary panel on Sunday.Committee chairman Nigel Hampton said the player s early admission of guilt and his remorse for his actions merited reducing a potential six-week suspension to four weeks.Luatua was shown a red card for thrusting out an arm and hitting Nanai-Williams around the throat when the Chiefs player did not have the ball.World Rugby is intent on eliminating head-high tackles and has directed match officials to show zero tolerance.Blues coach Tana Umaga said before the hearing that he accepted there should be no leniency. If you can t adjust your tackling style or tackling discipline, it s not going to be good for the team, Umaga said. We can t question Steven s want to do well for this team it is just a technical thing that he needs to work on.
