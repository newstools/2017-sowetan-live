At the Kaizer Chiefs awards last season, George Lebese spoke passionately about how he wants to see his name come up when nominees for big individual awards are announced.Despite finishing as Amakhosi's top scorer, Lebese did not have a good season.It started well, with promising performances which saw him bagging six goals in all competitions in the first two months of the season. Things, however, changed when he sustained an injury - on his groin - and he struggled for consistency when he recovered.This season has been even more frustrating for the player.In fact, since coach Stuart Baxter left Amakhosi in 2015, Lebese's game has not improved. The 28-year-old, who signed a three-year contract in 2015, has not reached his full potential and he's regressing.The fact that Lebese was left on the bench in league matches against Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates shows he's no longer as influential as he used to be at Chiefs."He has ambition, potential and all the attributes that modern coaches want, but I can't seem to understand why he can't take his game elsewhere so he would play regularly for the national team to attract good teams in international leagues," said former Chiefs midfielder Siyabonga Nkosi.Coach Steve Komphela has preferred Edmore Chirambadare on the left wing, ahead of Lebese.Chirambadare's work rate is impressive, but he's not as creative as Lebese, argued Nkosi."Chirambadare should be deputising for George, but it' all up to George to do some introspection. He needs to provide the goods that will force Steve to use him regularly."
