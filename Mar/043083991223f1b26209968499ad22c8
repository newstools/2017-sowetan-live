Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza has committed to change the lives of a distressed mining community near Baberton.Yesterday, Mabuza said he would build 1000 RDP houses for the community of Louisville, which is adjacent to Lily Mine, where three miners are still trapped underground following an accident in February last year.He said the construction of the houses should also create employment for the locals, whose job prospects have worsened following the closure of Lily Mine."We want the people here to live a better life; they should enjoy the fruits of their freedom," Mabuza said."We are of course concerned about the issue of the mine; our wish is to improve their lives while we attend to retrieving the bodies."Mabuza visited the area yesterday and held a meeting with community members, who raised their dissatisfaction with service delivery.Mineworkers Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyerende and Yvonne Mnisi have been trapped underground since February 5 last year. The mine has been closed ever since.There are about 6000 families living in the area. The completion of the 1000 RDP houses is planned for 2019.
