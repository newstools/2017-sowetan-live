Orlando Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret believes he can nurse struggling star playmaker Oupa Manyisa back to form and said he believes evidence that the process has already begun was there to see in Saturday s Soweto derby against Kaizer Chiefs.Jonevret is still searching for his first victory and to turn around Bucs winless run that now stretches to 12 matches.He knows that the task will not get any easier against 18-league match unbeaten SuperSport United at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday night.The coach though took the positives from what he saw as an improved performance from Pirates in their 1-1 Soweto Absa Premiership against Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday.Jonevret was most pleased by an energetic display at playmaker from Manyisa who has had a notably flat season since his return from injury late in 2015-16.The coach believes his men can beat SuperSport. There are no short cuts here. It s just hard work. And I think we can win the game on Tuesday Jonevret said. It s going to be a really tough one at home against SuperSport. But if we can play a game like the one against Chiefs we should be able to do it again against SuperSport on Tuesday. I haven t seen the players in every game. But I have heard since I have been here that Oupa for example had been out of form for a long time coming back from an injury. But I think everyone who watched this game [against Chiefs] saw that he was really on his way again. He is a really good footballer. The same with [Abbubaker] Mobara maybe. I think it is many of them who have taken steps. At least they look happy. But I don t know it s difficult for me because I was not in charge earlier. But I thought Oupa was really good [on Saturday]. Pirates two draws in Jonevret s first two games have seen them slip from 10th to 11th place.Jonevret started with a 1-1 draw against Polokwane City at Orlando Stadium.SuperSport s unbeaten run sees them in third place on 36 points from 19 matches. - TMG Digital
