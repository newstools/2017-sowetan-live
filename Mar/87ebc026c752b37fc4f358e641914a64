Has Oupa Manyisa got an ace up his sleeve for the Soweto derby? "Ace" has struggled for form this season and as captain, has not led Orlando Pirates by example.The Mohlakeng, West Rand-born midfielder has come under scrutiny from a section of the Bucs supporters and based on his statistics, perhaps the criticism is fair.He has made 19 appearances in all competitions this season, but has not been effective going forward with only one goal, which came in the 2-1 loss to Bloemfontein Celtic in December, and three assists to show all season.New Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret commented at the weekend that he was aware of talk that Manyisa had lost his sparkle, but insisted that the skipper played well in the 1-1 draw against Polokwane City."I heard his form has gone a little down. I think Oupa was absolutely OK [against City], because I know he's a really good football player. He's [heading] in the right direction now, I hope," said Jonevret.It is, however, worth noting that it was the first time Manyisa was taken off this season, when he was replaced by Issa Sarr with eight minutes remaining against Polokwane City.At the height of his game, the 28-year-old played a club record 51 games in the 2013-14 season, an achievement he shares with Williams Okpara and the late Senzo Meyiwa.Gone are those days because Manyisa has been a shadow of his former self since his long-term ankle injury in September 2015, which kept him out of action for 10 months.The big question now is can the derby against Kaizer Chiefs revive Manyisa?It is, of course, easier said than done.The central midfielder will come up against the likes of George Maluleka, who's been in good form for the Glamour Boys, and Chiefs's anchorman Willard Katsande.Jonevret is confident that his players, including Manyisa, can compete against anyone and all they need to do is regain their confidence."I told them they must start believing in themselves because they are good football players. They just have to start to believe," he said.Manyisa missed the last derby - a 0-0 draw in October - when he withdrew from the starting line-up after battling with stomach problems.Saturday may be his chance to show if he's still got the magic, or claims that he's over the hill will persist.
