"I'm just glad that we won."Tau and Dolly know each other from their days at Mamelodi Sundowns and the former admitted that he had missed Dolly since he moved to France where he plays for Montpellier."I missed him a bit. Keagan is a good player."The 22-year-old will, however, not get ahead of himself simply because he was on the scoresheet. Tau acknowledged that winning a permanent place in the national team will be a daunting task."We have a lot of good players in the national team and I will always be grateful to come to the national team."I have a chance to develop in the national team. We have young and experienced players. It is unbelievable to see the talent here," he said.Tau is hopeful that continuing to play in the CAF Champions League will enhance his chances of regular national team action."I think I've had a lot of success in CAF. It's all international football, so it is the same. I've been in the final and I've been to the Fifa Club World Cup, so that has made my next step to the national team a lot easier," he said. "I'm focusing on my work ... I'm supported by a lot of people who see a lot of good things in me."
