If Nkululelo "The Bulldog" Mhlongo does in the ring on Sunday what he has been doing in the gym for four weeks, then the vacant WBF junior middleweight belt is his.This pronouncement was made yesterday by Mhlongo's proficient trainer Lehlohonolo "Hands of Stone" Ledwaba, who was in a buoyant mood before their departure to Germany yesterday.SA champion Mhlongo, from Eshowe in KZN, will oppose Rafael Bejaran for the vacant belt in Hamburg on Sunday."Nkululeko has been marvellous in the gym and that is what he needs in the ring on Sunday," said Ledwaba who produced his first world champion in 2014 when he assisted Zolani Tete to win the IBF junior bantamweight belt in Japan."He joined me four weeks ago and we hit the ground running because the fight had already been signed for [late January]. I see no reason why we cannot come back victorious."Ledwaba described Bejaran as being a one- dimensional fighter."He waits for you to commit and comes right at you. I saw that from two of his fights. Our [aim] is to come out smoking and work harder because this guy will be enjoying home advantage."Ledwaba said: "What is key in this fight is high work rate."Mhlongo has 15 wins from 18 fights, while Bejaran has 22 victories in 25 fights.
