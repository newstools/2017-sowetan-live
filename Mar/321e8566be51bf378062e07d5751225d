The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) is to ask the high court in Pretoria on Thursday to order Tasima to hand over the eNatis system.The system is used to administer driver s and vehicle licence applications and renewals learner s licence bookings as well as notifications of changes to vehicle ownership and new vehicle registrations.In November last year the Constitutional Court declared that the extension of the contract in terms of which Tasima has operated the system since 2010 was invalid and ordered Tasima to hand over the system to RTMC within 30 days.However Tasima failed to comply with the court order.The agency wants the court to order Tasima to vacate the premises from which is operates the eNatis as these premises are a national key point.It also seeks an order declaring that Tasima and its directors are in contempt of the Constitutional Court ruling.
