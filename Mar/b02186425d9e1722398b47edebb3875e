Owen da Gama has declared himself qualified and ready to take over the Bafana Bafana hot seat on a permanent basis.His comments come on the eve of the SA Football Association (Safa) naming the new Bafana coach who will replace Shakes Mashaba, who was fired in December for misconduct. Former Orlando Pirates coach Ruud Krol is tipped as the new man.Safa president Danny Jordaan had promised the new coach would be named after Tuesday night's 0-0 draw with Angola. In a post-match press conference on Tuesday, Da Gama said he was ready to replace Mashaba.His tone painted a picture of a disappointed man who might have been overlooked for the national team coaching job."Whatever happens will happen but I think I'm very capable. I've proved it beyond any doubt. I hear about people qualifying and I'm not qualifying. I think I should understand it a little bit more," said Da Gama."With the exposure that we got at U-23, with over 50 matches that I've been part of Bafana, watching over 1200 games in the country - I think I have an idea of what's happening within the national setup."Da Gama's 11-year PSL experience saw him coach at Platinum Stars and Orlando Pirates. He's unbeaten in the two Bafana matches he was in charge of, including the 3-1 victory over Guinea-Bissau.Bafana resume their World Cup qualifiers in August and September with back-to-back matches against Cape Verde.
