Army general Bakri Hassan Saleh, a military officer involved in the bloodless coup that brought President Omar al-Bashir to power three decades ago, was yesterday sworn in as Sudan's first prime minister since the post was scrapped in a 1989 Islamist-backed coup.Saleh was sworn in a day earlier by the executive bureau of Bashir's National Congress Party. The 68-year-old Saleh took the oath as prime minister at a presidential palace in Khartoum. He will also continue as first vice-president.Bashir abolished the post of prime minister after the coup, and analysts said the appointment of Saleh as premier was an attempt by the president to give his decades-old regime a new look.The appointment falls in line with reforms proposed by a year-long national dialogue held between Bashir's government and some opposition groups.In October, after a quarter century in power, Bashir concluded the national dialogue aimed at resolving insurgencies in Sudan's border regions and healing the country's crisis-wracked economy.Sudanese lawmakers had voted in December to reinstate the post of prime minister. The talks, launched in 2015, were boycotted by most mainstream opposition and armed groups."Our country is at a historic moment as it harmonises all political parties and powers who participated in the national dialogue," Saleh said in a brief statement after taking oath."General Bakri's appointment is broadly a continuation of Bashir's rule rather than a new chapter in Sudan's politics," Khaled Tigani, editor-in-chief of weekly newspaper Elaff, told AFP.Saleh, a key aide to Bashir for decades, has previously held important government ministerial portfolios like interior and defence. He has also been adviser to Bashir on national security and was head of the country's all powerful National Security and Intelligence Service in the 1990s. Bashir had led the 1989 coup against then-prime minister Sadiq al-Mahdi with the help of Islamist leader Hassan al-Turabi.Mahdi fled abroad more than two years ago but returned to Sudan last month.A fixture of Sudanese politics since the 1960s, Mahdi served as prime minister from 1966 to 1967 and again from 1986 to 1989. His government was the last to be democratically elected in Sudan before the coup.
