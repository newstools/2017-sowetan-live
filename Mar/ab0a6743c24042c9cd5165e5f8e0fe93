Eskom has suspended the planned interruption of bulk power supply to the Govan Mbeki and the Thaba Chweu Local Municipalities in Mpumalanga after reaching agreements for the settlements of their arrears debt.The electricity parastatal said on Sunday that both municipalities had committed to provide their respective council resolutions to support the agreements by close of business on March 14. We are very pleased with this progressive development as it secures the electricity supply to municipalities while ensuring that they honour their debts. Eskom will continue to work with all municipalities in developing long-term sustainable plans that will ensure municipalities stay out of the debt trap said Group Executive for Customer Services Ayanda Noah.
