Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan must be redeployed but his deputy Mcebisi Jonas should not even be considered for the top post, says ANC Youth League.The ruling party's youth body re-iterated its calls for Gordhan to be axed as the minister appeared before the parliament s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) on the debacle surrounding the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) on Tuesday.According to the Youth League, Gordhan must be moved to another post and be replaced with someone who will "drive President Jacob Zuma's radical transformation agenda".ANCYL's national spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize said that they are re-iterating the call they made in February calling for President Zuma to consider redeploying Gordhan as they believe he is the "protector of white monopoly capital". "These are not new reasons but part of the reasons we have given. Gordhan might be the right person in terms of the body, but he is not the mind that we want," said Mkhize.Mkhize said that Gordhan is in the ministerial position because the president was forced to appoint him due to the markets reacting negatively following the appointment of Des van Rooyen in December 2015."Remember he was appointed by the markets. The rand was collapsing and he had to be appointed.""He must be redeployed because we are not married to a name, we are married to an agenda," said Mkhize adding that Gordhan cannot drive the radical economic transformation agenda.He compared Gordhan's appointment to that of a prefect at a school saying that prefects are appointed by teachers and the markets [that he says appointed Gordhan] played the role of the teachers.Asked who would be a capable person to drive the economic transformation agenda, Mkhize said that as the Youth League, they leave that in the hands of President Zuma but said that the person he decides to replace Gordhan with should not be Jonas.Mkhize said that if they had to choose between Gordhan and Mcebisi they would choose to stick with Gordhan."It is better to deal with a prefect [Gordhan] than a person who misleads the public," he said.Mkhize alleged that Jonas is always preaching transparency but has not been transparent on why and how he left the Eastern Cape.According to Mkhize, Jonas "benefited out of a R68-million questionable procurement" during funeral of the former President Nelson Mandela.
