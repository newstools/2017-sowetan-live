Orlando Pirates 12-match run without a win came to an end at the Siza Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane on Sunday as they edged past EC Bees 3-1 to book a place in the second round of the Nedbank Cup.But it was not as impressive as they might have hoped against an energetic semi-professional side with new coach Kjell Jonevret suggesting his Pirates side were still well short of confidence.Pirates last won in November when they were last in the eastern Cape against Chippa United and will be hoping now that they have turned a corner but Jonevret said there still much work ahead.Pirates led 1-0 at half-time through Dove Wome, extending the lead with a wonderous free kick from Mpho Makola early in the second half before EC Bees came right back at them and pulled one back through Bongani Chikila.But Thamsqana Gabuza made sure of the result with a tap-in in the 66th minute after which Bees had run out of sting.The semi-pro side from the ABC Motsepe League, who are chasing promotion to the National First Division, came out of the starting blocks like men possessed to offer Pirates an awkward welcome on a rare visit to the area.But it did not take long for the Buccaneers to impress their superiority with Wome putting a low header wide in the ninth minute before opening the scoring six minutes later.Bees gave Makola too much space on the edge of the penalty area and he ghosted past two defenders before putting the ball back across the goal for Wome to tuck away.It should have been 2-0 almost straight from the kick off as Wome proved an inadvertent provider despite a poor cross for Bernard Morrison, but the Ghana international blasted his shot against the crossbar when it would have been easier just to tap-in.It was a chance for Morrison to show new coach Jonevret his potential as he made a first start since November. It was also a chance for back-up keeper Siyabonga Mpontshane, who had not featured in goal for the Buccaneers since the 2015 Telkom Knockout semifinal against Kaizer Chiefs an absence of some 16 months.Gabuza had two good chances in the first half to also extend the score but on both occasions he headed off target.It was 2-0 in the 52nd minute when Makola hit his free kick straight over the advancing goalkeeper from way out on the touchline. A special goal from gifted player.But within three minute Bees were right back in the contest as Pirates were stripped of possession and Chikila went through to score, albeit with the help of a healthy deflection off Ayanda Gcaba's heal.The home side then had Bucs under pressure for a decent spell before Gabuza tapped in Wome s cross to make sure of Pirates progress. - TMG Digital
