It's the game that we all want to win," Mahlangu said, before adding that he was feeling fully fit following his injury troubles."I worked hard, I'm sure the coach saw it, I'm happy that I was given the opportunity to do my best in this match."So I feel much better than before," he said.Mahlangu signed a three-year deal with Dinamo in September. - TMG Digital
