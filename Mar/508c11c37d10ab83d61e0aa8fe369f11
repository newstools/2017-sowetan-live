Oxfam South Africa has called on government to decriminalise informal mining which it says is largely misunderstood.The anti-poverty campaigners made the statement following the death of 14 illegal miners who were found dead this week in derelict mines in Benoni in Gauteng s East Rand.The death of a five-year-old boy who fell into a disused mine also underscored the problem Oxfam said. We call on the South African government to decriminalise informal mining and for this sector which is worth billions of Rands to be properly regulated and licensed as envisioned by the African Mining Vision the NGO said in a statement. Government must acknowledge the role of artisanal mining in macro economic development in household income job creation and securing livelihoods for the majority of the poor and unemployed. Oxfam said it was a myth that all informal miners are non-nationals illegal migrants are part of the syndicates or do so with the intention to become part of the wider syndicates and underground gangs . Naturally when under threat these unregulated miners respond by defending and arming themselves. Lawlessness will mount if this issue and related issues are not addressed properly Oxfam said. It is a dereliction of duty and a display of short-sightedness to only act when there is loss of life. Oxfam SA is ready to partner with others and with government to unpack the dynamics and opportunities which lie in a proactive approach on informal mining. It cited a report by South Africa s Human Rights Commission which called for more researched into informal mining. Building the evidence base in this case entails looking into building trust and networks in this sector and to remove the suspicion that shrouds such activities. This means identifying the size shape and scope of artisanal mining the 2015 report by the Human Rights Commission said.
