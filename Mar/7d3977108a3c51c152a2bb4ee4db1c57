A year to the day after a terrorist outrage in Brussels a South African has described the aftermath of a deadly attack outside the British Parliament in Westminister London.Four people including the assailant are dead in what British police are treating as a terrorist attack .The man who allegedly stabbed a policeman to death was shot and killed by police.At least two other people died after a Hyundai SUV was driven across the Westminister bridge and purposely steered into pedestrians.Lamese Waterfield a South African freelance journalist in London says she has never seen the area around the British Parliament so quiet in the wake of the attack. I am currently in Westminster. Aside from journalists and police the area around Parliament is virtually a ghost town. This is normally one of the busiest sections of London with ten of thousands of people commuting... It s rush hour. They would be leaving work heading into the stations but it s a completely eerie feeling. I have never seen such a large of police presence in the ten years that I have been in London. It is unclear if the man who has been shot was driving the grey Hyundai which struck a railing in Westminister after knocking people over.Several were hit by the car and left badly injured people with one apparently pushed under a bus. A critically injured women was also rescued from the Thames river.French students have been injured by the attack according to the French Prime minister. TMG Digital
