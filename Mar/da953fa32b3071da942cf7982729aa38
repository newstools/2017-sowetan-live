Thapelo Morena travelled with Mamelodi Sundowns to Alexandria, Egypt, for the final of last year's CAF Champions League, but he unfortunately could play no part in one of local football's most proud moments on the continent.As he was not registered to play in the competition, Morena did not get an opportunity to play in front of the the passionate Zamalek supporters who created an amazing atmosphere with their singing and lasers and cellphone flash lights.As Sundowns begin the defence of their Champions League title, Morena wants to make up for all the times he could do nothing but watch from the stands as his teammates conquered Africa.Sundowns face Kampala Capital City Authority FC of Uganda in the first round, first leg tie at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm) and Morena looks set to get his first taste of Champions League football. Having already played in the CAF Super Cup against DRC giants TP Mazembe, he has a good idea of what to expect."I am looking forward to the game because the last time they [Sundowns] won the Champions League I was not registered, but now I am going to be part of the team."I am willing to deliver more, as I have been delivering in the PSL."We want the cup again. If we get the cup, then we'll be making history again," said the former Bloemfontein Celtic winger."It's going to be a difficult game, but we are going to work hard to win the game."We hope for the win. I am sure they [Kampala] have been watching our games and they know what they are going to come up against."Despite being the champions, Morena's teammate Anthony Laffor does not think Sundowns are the favourites to win this year's edition.Clubs around the continent would have no doubt certainly taken note of how Sundowns played last year and they will be taking Pitso Mosimane's side seriously."I don't think we are the favourites. We need to keep our feet on the ground."We need to forget about what happened last year because it's history."We need to concentrate on the games we will play," said Laffor.
