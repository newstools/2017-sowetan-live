The rand was hovering around R13/$ on Wednesday morning as the market waited to see how the drama between President Jacob Zuma and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan would play out.Much coverage has been devoted to the rand s swing from R12.32/$ to R13.05/$ after Zuma ordered Gordhan to return from an investor road show in London.Perhaps more alarming is the 42 basis point rise to 8.73% on the yield on government s benchmark R186 bonds.According to Trading Economics South African government debt is about $53.8 billion so Zuma s move has added about $202 million (around R2.6 billion) to the government s annual interest bill.Winners in the rapidly sinking rand include synthetic oil producer Sasol whose share price jumped 5.89% to R382.21 on Tuesday.The JSE s miners generally benefited from the weaker currency led by African Rainbow Minerals which gained 8.28% to R94.80.The sale of Naspers s 36.4% stake in Souq.com to Amazon.com helped its shares rise 3.11% to R2 305.49 on Tuesday.Telkom for reasons that are not clear since it is not a rand hedge jumped 5.67% to R76.27 on Tuesday.The funeral of struggle hero Ahmed Kathrada on Wednesday morning is likely to divert attention away from the unfolding drama in South African politics for a few hours. -TMG/BDLive
