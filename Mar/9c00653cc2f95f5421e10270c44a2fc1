Ajax Cape Town s Prince Nxumalo has had no ill effects since last month s latest epileptic attack which saw him removed from the starting line-up before the 5-0 mauling by Bidvest Wits.It has been more than month since the incident on February 7 and there have been no more problems coach Stanley Menzo said.Striker Nxumalo has a history of epilepsy problems and had to be hospitalised and stay behind in Johannesburg after the game at Bidvest Stadium.His latest attack happened the night before the game against Wits. Since that game he hasn t had any problems said Menzo. We have brought him on slowly and he has been training fully with the team. Since last month s attack Nxumalo has come on as a late substitute against Kaizer Chiefs on February 25 and last weekend travelled with the Ajax squad for their goalless draw against high flying SuperSport United but was an unused substitute. I think he is ready to play added Menzo whose side next have a Nedbank Cup tie against Kwadukuza United in Durban on Saturday afternoon.The 26-year-old Nxumalo twice suffered epileptic attacks while on the field last season forcing a prolonged absence that also affected his chances of winning the Absa Premiership s Golden Boot eventually finishing one goal shy of winner Collins Mbesuma.Nxumalo also missed the final game of last season against Wits as the team s medical staff were worried he could suffer a relapse.This season Nxumalo has scored three league goals. - TMG Digital
