David Kannemeyer has backed Mamelodi Sundowns to come away victorious when they visit Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm) in the weekend's big match.Kannemeyer, a former Chiefs and Sundowns left- back, feels the defending champions are more consistent than Amakhosi and are more solid in defence.Fourth-placed Chiefs have drawn their last three matches, while fifth-placed Sundowns were defeated by Cape Town City and then held to a surprising goalless draw by Polokwane City in their last match.So you can imagine how desperate both sides will be for the three points to boost their chances in this unpredictable title race. The clubs are separated by just two points."It's going to be a huge game. Sundowns have games in hand and Pitso [Mosimane] wants to pick up points," said Kannemeyer, who won the league title with both sides."I will give this one to Sundowns because I think they are more consistent. Chiefs have blown hot and cold this season."That's their problem. They will have to pick up their socks if they want to win this game. It's going to be interesting."Chiefs are a bit shaky when it comes to defending. Sundowns are more solid with the likes of [Wayne] Arendse, [Tebogo] Langerman and the new defender [Fares Hachi]."In midfield - where there's going to be an intriguing battle - Kannemeyer has backed Downs captain Hlompho Kekana to outshine Chiefs' Willard Katsande."Kekana will be a step ahead because he played international games [for Bafana Bafana]. I think he will be on top form."
