The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) on Sunday demanded the resignation or recall by the president of social development minister Bathabile Dlamini over the Sassa crisis.The federation handed over a memorandum to a department representative during a picket outside parliament on Sunday.Cosatu spokesperson Tony Ehrenreich said they were concerned about a lack of political leadership from Dlamini regarding the mismanagement of social grants.Their demands included an investigation into Cash Paymaster Services the company which holds the current contract declared invalid by the constitutional court to pay grants for corruption . (This is) both in terms of how the constitutional court decision was violated and whether the deductions that CPS had allowed from pensioners whether that was as a result of corrupt practices he said. It would also be to see what political linkages there are between CPS and Net1 and the politicians said Ehrenreich.He said they were also calling for the presidency to intervene and make sure that services would be provided in April and that if a new contract is signed with CPS it last no longer than three months. After that a new service provider must be provided whether it be the Post Bank or anyone else it must be done in a transparent process said Ehrenreich. - TMG Digital
