The Ndebele king has declared his arranged customary law marriage of three years as fake, apparently in a bid to prevent his wife, with whom he says he has never "shared a bed", from getting half of his estate.King Makhosonke II ( Enock Mabhena) has been embroiled in a bitter divorce from his wife Nozipho Prisca Mnguni, 26, at the KwaMhlanga Magistrate's Court, Mpumalanga. Mnguni filed for divorce in December 2015, citing lack of love and financial support from the king.Mabhena, 57, was declared the legitimate Ndebele king in 2010 after a five-year investigation by the Nhlapo Commission which was charged with resolving kingship disputes.On Friday, the king's legal representative Thulani Mtsuki argued using the requirements for the conclusion of a valid customary marriage in terms of Section 3 of the Recognition of Customary Act to shield him.The Act states that customary marriages are automatically classified in terms of community of property laws, unless an ante-nuptial contract is entered into. This means should the king's marriage be validated by court, Mnguni, will be entitled to half of his estate including pension fund. Mabhena earns R1.3-million a year from the state and has business interests.Mokgala Moabi, Mnguni's lawyer, said: "The defendant had consented to the marriage and if it was not verbally it was by his conduct at the wedding, as he was seated next to the plaintiff and vows were exchanged. We will submit photos as exhibits to this effect."Mtsuki said the king was not required to provide for Mnguni because their marriage was not valid as he never consented to it, nor did he personally pay lobolo for her or shared a bed with her at any stage. He said the king's siblings arranged the marriage behind his back, despite their wedding in 2014. "The defendant was merely moving with the flow," he said."Love is not a requirement for the conclusion of a customary marriage according to the Act but common sense says people need to be in love first before marrying each other."That was not [the] case here. .. if a man wants to get married, surely they must pay for their lobolo and not their siblings."The case was postponed to May.sifilel@sowetan.co.za
