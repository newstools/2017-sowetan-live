As Orioh Molapo left the dock and headed to the cells after his case was postponed, Nothemba Lebepe, the principal he allegedly stabbed more than 20 times, took off her sunglasses and shouted to him: "I'm here."Molapo flashed a smile and responded with "Seke wa lwana" (don't fight) before disappearing to the holding cells.Molapo, 45, an ex-teacher at Paul Mosaka Primary School in Pimville, Soweto, is facing charges of attempted murder, malicious damage to property and fraud relating to his academic qualifications.For the first time since November 14 last year, Lebepe yesterday came face to face with the man who allegedly attacked her at the school.Speaking to Sowetan outside the Lenasia Regional Court, Lebepe said she felt nothing when she saw Molapo after the ordeal that almost killed her."I wanted to see him because I'm not afraid of him, I'm not scared of him and he knows I'm not scared of him and I have told him that."It's alleged Lebepe and Molapo had been at loggerheads for years over his fake qualifications that led to him being sacked by the Gauteng department of education in 2015.She said on the day of the incident she knew she was not alone and that her ancestors and God were with her. She said the attack happened on the same day that her sister died seven years ago. "I had been waiting for him for a very long time. It did not shock me when it happened. I had been waiting for it to happen since 2010."It's been difficult but my pillar of strength has been my God and that is why he couldn't touch me. Other people can die from just one stab wound and I've survived so many."She said she harboured no hard feelings against Molapo and God would deal with him.
