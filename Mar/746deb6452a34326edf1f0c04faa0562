"We are hurt and pained by the removal of the Minister of Finance and his deputy, Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas on the basis of a very suspect intelligence report," Jackson Mthembu said on Friday. Gordhan and Jonas were axed by President Jacob Zuma in the early hours of Friday when he announced his decision to reshuffle his cabinet.Malusi Gigaba has been appointed Finance Minister while Sfiso Buthelezi takes over from Jonas as his deputy.The African National Congress (ANC) chief whip in parliament took to Facebook on Friday to relay his displeasure at the president's decision to remove two people that he has described as dedicated and committed."Both these comrades have served the ANC , its government and the people of SA with utmost dedication, selfless commitment characterised by high levels of incorruptibility , high levels of integrity and morality," Mthembu wrote.It is reported that Gordhan and Jonas were fired on the basis of a so-called intelligence report which suggested the two had planned to use their trips to both London and the United States to meet with people in an attempt mobilise financial markets against the country."These comrades can never and will never sell their souls and country to foreign forces . I disagree with their removal and reasons expressed for their removal . In my book cde [comrade] Pravin Gordhan and cde Mncebisi Jonas were good protectors and defenders of our public purse "The Thabo Mbeki Foundation said although it respects that it is the president's prerogative to fire and hire ministers, it is concerned that the cabinet reshuffle happens at a time when there's "persistent and serious" concern about the state of the nation."That concern and unease was expressed by the general public during the August 2016 Local Government Elections which, among others, resulted in significant loss of support for the ANC, the dominant governing party in our country since 1994," the foundation said in a statement."It is absolutely certain that the major change in the membership of the National Executive represented by today s extensive Cabinet reshuffle will further deepen this serious public concern and unease."The foundation has called on the president to break down his reasons behind the decision to reshuffle the cabinet."Given unprecedented nature and widespread public concern surrounding this reshuffle, we therefore hope that President Zuma will take the necessary and urgent steps to explain to the country more than he has, why the changes in the National Executive he has effected were necessary in the public interest, including as this relates to such portfolios as the Treasury, Energy, Public Works, Transport, Public Service and Administration, and the Police."We accept that under normal circumstances there is no need for the President publicly to explain changes to the composition of the National Executive. However both the extent of the Cabinet reshuffle and the circumstances in which it has occurred are not normal."It is therefore imperative that President Zuma and the rest of the ANC leadership use the occasion of today s major Cabinet reshuffle constructively to respond to the existing serious public concern and unease about the state of the nation, which could result in major and very serious social instability if it is not addressed honestly and properly."
