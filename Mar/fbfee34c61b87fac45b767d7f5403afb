Ahead of Saturday's Soweto derby, Sihle Ndebele asked members of the public what they think about ticket prices, which range from R70 to R170.Melusi Nhlapho, gardener, 30, from Kagiso.Sometimes people want to take their families to the stadium and that will be tough if tickets are starting from R70. I would have liked to go and watch but I do not have that amount of money.Justice Manamela, courier, 45, from MeadowlandsI believe that the tickets are cheap when they start at R70 because it is a big game. I have already bought a ticket.Peter Thlathla, 56, self-employed, from AlexandraIf the tickets were R40, I would have already bought one or two but because of this R70 I am hesitating to buy them. I might watch the game on television.David Ngwane, 46, unemployed, from Jabavu.The tickets are cheap but I will not attend the game because I think it will be unsafe after what happened in Loftus in that Pirates versus Sundowns game.
