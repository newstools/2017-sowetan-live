It's hard to believe that defender Ramahlwe Mphahlele has only seven caps for Bafana Bafana. But he's yearning for more.For someone who captained all the junior national teams, you would expect Mphahlele to be one of the country's most capped players, but it wasn't until 2014 that he received his first call-up to Bafana. This was despite the fact that he's always been a regular in the PSL since making his debut for Moroka Swallows as a 17-year-old in 2007."I captained the U-17s and U-20s from start to finish. I only captained the U-23 team in one match," the Kaizer Chiefs defender told Sowetan shortly after his seventh appearance for Bafana in the 3-1 win over Guinea-Bissau at Moses Mabhida Stadium at the weekend."Hopefully I will earn more caps. The only thing I can do is to perform and hope that whoever selects the team, and is looking for a right-back, thinks of me," added Mphahlele, who made his Bafana debut in last year's 4-0 win over Gambia.Mphahlele may get another opportunity to cement his place in the team when Bafana take on Angola at Buffalo City Stadium tonight (7pm).If history is anything to go by, Mphahlele and his team mates shouldn't have a problem. The two countries have met 14 times with SA winning eight, drawing five and losing once.
