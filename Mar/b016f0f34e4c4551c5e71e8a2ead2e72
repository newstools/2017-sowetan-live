The R118 million now wasted to date on Durban's aborted Commonwealth Games bid should anger every citizen of EThekwini.This is according to Zwakele Mncwango the Democratic Alliance's KwaZulu-Natal leader."This is a devastating blow to our city and our people who can only stand by and watch as millions of rands that could have improved our communities delivered houses improved services and created jobs have been wasted by the ANC government.""This is a potent stain on the work of Minister Fikile Mbalula..."I will now demand a full-scale investigation by the Municipal Public Accounts Committee (MPAC) into the total cost wasted by the City of EThekwini through its involvement in the Commonwealth Games bid."Mncwango said the City of EThekwini "has a record of wasting millions on superfluous events like the Essence Festival which cost the City millions of rands and yielded absolutely no results. The people of EThekwini deserve better than (this kind of) job-killing financial recklessness."High-ranking sports officials from across the globe representing the Games gathered in London from Friday to deliberate over Durban s status of 2022 Commonwealth Games host.The city won the rights to host the multi-sport event in September 2015 but South African officials missed crucial deadlines including the establishment of a local organising committee and payment guarantees. - TMG Digital.
