It was almost as if Thursday s midnight Cabinet reshuffle didn t happen when President Jacob Zuma strode into a packed tent in Mbizana in the Eastern Cape on Friday morning.Zuma was in a jovial mood as thousands of people welcomed him with open arms. He was in town to launch the Mbizana Regional Enterprise Hub (RED) at Dyifanai village. We'll blame you if economy tanks says ANC veteran Andrew Mlangeni The throngs of people seemed oblivious to widespread condemnation of the president s decision to make 20 changes to his cabinet including controversially firing Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.Some villagers probably unaware of such developments were seen on horseback wearing ANC T-shirts emblazoned with Zuma s face.As he got up to speak the crowd rose to its feet burst into applause and then started singing Zuma s trademark Umshini wam song.
