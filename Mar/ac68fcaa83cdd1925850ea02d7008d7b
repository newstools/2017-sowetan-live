Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is not a big fan of statistics.So, if you tell him that two of the last three Champions League champions did not reach the group stages the year after winning it, he will counter your argument with a different statistic that favours Sundowns.The fact that TP Mazembe and Al Ahly were knocked out before the group stages as defending champions in recent years is something Sundowns need to worry about, especially after they conceded at home during Friday's 2-1 first leg victory over Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA). Bangaly Soumahoro and Ricardo Nascimento were on the score sheet for Downs.Bidvest Wits, meanwhile, will feel they have a good chance of progressing to the Champions League group stages after they were defeated 1-0 by Egyptian giants Al Ahly on Saturday. The second leg will be played here on Friday.Last night, SuperSport United lost 2-3 away to El-Ahly Shandy in the Confed Cup, getting crucial away goals by Mario Booysen and Jeremy Brockie.
