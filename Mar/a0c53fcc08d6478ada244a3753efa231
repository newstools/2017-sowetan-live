What Free State Stars need to avoid, according to coach Serame Letsoaka, is leaving it too late to turn things around.Currently second from bottom, Ea Lla Koto have nine matches to save what's been a chaotic season.During the Fifa break, Stars played friendly matches against the Lesotho national team (1-1) and Kaizer Chiefs (2-1 loss), in preparation for Saturday's Absa Premiership clash against Orlando Pirates at James Motlatsi Stadium (6pm)."I had a lot of injuries, so the Fifa break gave players time to recover ," he said.Stars are determined to improve on their record of just one win in six matches under the tutelage of Letsoaka. A victory over Pirates will boost their confidence.
