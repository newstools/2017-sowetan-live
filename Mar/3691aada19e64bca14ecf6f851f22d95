He now has to motivate to the Department of Home Affairs why he needs to get his South African citizenship back and it is unclear how long that will take.South Africa allows for individuals to obtain dual citizenship. The Dutch, however, have tried to limit dual citizenship as much as possible, with strict rules on who can obtain this.According to Safa, Mokotjo has indicated that he wants to play for Bafana, but it's easier said than done.By the time of going to print yesterday, the matter had not been resolved."We need to speak to the player to get all the details. We understand that this is a matter of urgency, but everything has to be done by the book," Home Affairs spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete said yesterday."If you don't apply for retention, then you lose your citizenship. So that means when you apply for [South African] citizenship, you need to motivate. We are looking to find out how his [Dutch] citizenship was obtained. We hope to have clarity by the end of today [yesterday]."Mokotjo has been training with Bafana this week ahead of their international friendly against Guinea-Bissau at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday.The midfielder is considered one of SA's best midfielders, but has not been given a fair chance to prove himself in a senior national team jersey.On Monday, Safa said they were working around the clock to get the Mokotjo issue resolved after finding out through the media that the player had renounced his South African citizenship.
