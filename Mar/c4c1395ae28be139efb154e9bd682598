Lions coach Johan Ackermann said he would be sending his strongest team to face the Jaguares in Buenos Aires on Saturday evening. But the absentees from the touring group are noticeable.Elton Jantjies (paternity leave) Rohan Janse van Rensburg (compassionate leave) Lionel Mapoe (rest) Franco Mostert (rest) and Ruan Combrinck (injured) are the big name players who will not be making the trans-Atlantic trip.This was the case last year in the final set of Super Rugby round robin matches and they paid the ultimate price.They lost 34-22 against an ever-improving side that only lost to two South African side at home (Stormers 13-8) and (Sharks 25-22).The Jaguares had beaten the Bulls 29-11 to end their hopes of a play-off berth two weeks before the Lions surrendered their chance to secure a course for a home final.While the Lions disposed of the Crusaders and the Highlanders in the quarterfinals and semi-finals they had to make the trek across the Indian Ocean to face the Hurricanes in the final.They lost that game 20-3 but such was the form of the Hurricanes that it would not have been a surprise if the Hurricanes had come to Johannesburg and won the final.As witnessed from the two South African matches the Jaguares have taken part in they will be a difficult side to beat.If their discipline did not fail them in Cape Town they could have given the Stormers a heart attack while they were full value for their 39-26 opening round win against the Southern Kings.Fortunately for the Lions they have got the Argentine obstacle early in the tournament and points lost here can be recovered.The weak Australian teams like the Rebels Force and Reds will provide the necessary cannon-fodder but how the Lions fare will be a marker in terms of their travelling ability for the play-off stages. - TMG Digital
