Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has no doubt in his mind that midfielder Willard Katsande will sign a new contract with the club in the near future.While the likes of Siphiwe Tshabalala, Tsepo Masilela, Lucky Baloyi and Kgotso Moleko have been given new contracts recently, Katsande's future with Amakhosi is yet to be finalised.Komphela, however, revealed that discussions are ongoing and there are "a lot of positives".Katsande, 31, joined Amakhosi in 2011 from Ajax Cape Town and has gone on to become a key component in the club's midfield, after a slow start to life in Naturena under former coach Vladimir Vermezovic."We are optimistic he will stay because there are discussions going on," Komphela said."I don't have any other idea except him being with us in the coming season and adding the same value he does consistently."Katsande has stated that he will give first preference to Chiefs.
