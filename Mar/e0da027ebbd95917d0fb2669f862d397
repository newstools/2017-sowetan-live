Ayanda Patosi has ended a four-month spell with a start at Belgian side Lokeren when he returned to the line-up for the 0-0 draw with Charleroi on Sunday.Patosi s refusal to sign a new contract at the club had seen him frozen out at the club and his previous appearance against Eupen on October 29 seemingly his last for the side.But coach R nar Kristinsson has done an about-turn and brought Patosi back into the fold in a week in which he was dropped from the Bafana Bafana squad for the friendlies against Guinea-Bissau and Angola later this month.Patosi not only started but also completed a league game for the first time this season a sign that his fitness is at a good level as well.The match was the final round of the regular season in Belgium with Lokeren now competing in the play-offs for a place in the UEFA Europa League next season.Andile Jali was also restored to the KV Oostende starting line-up as they drew 2-2 with Standard Liege the first time he has been in the first XI for a month.Oostende s good form this season means they have qualified for the Championship play-offs which sees the top six sides compete for the league trophy.Lars Veldwijk who has been included in the latest Bafana squad was a second half substitute for Kortrijk as they lost 2-0 at Royal Excelsior Mouscron a result which saw the latter escape relegation on the final day of the regular season.Keagan Dolly was back in the Montpellier starting line-up in France but lasted a little over an hour as his side were defeated 3-2 at home by Nantes.Kamohelo Mokotjo played the full 90 minutes for FC Twente as they lost 3-0 to Ajax Amsterdam in Holland while Tokelo Rantie came on at halftime for his Turkish side Genclerbirligi as they were edged 3-2 by Galatasaray.Bongani Zungu a surprise omission from the latest Bafana squad came on for the final 15 minutes as his Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes were held to a 3-3 draw by Estoril but Haashim Domingo received a red card for the Vitoria B side as they drew their second-tier clash with Sporting Covilh 2-2.Lebogang Phiri just back from injury came on at halftime for Danish club Brondby in a 2-0 win at Horsens while Lehlogonolo Masalesa was replaced midway through the second half as his Greek club Larissa lost 1-0 at Panionios. - TMG Digital
