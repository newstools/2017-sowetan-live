Bafana Bafana go into tonight's friendly encounter with Angola at Buffalo City Stadium (7pm) eager to extend their impressive run of 16 unbeaten matches.The national team have in recent years been criticised for excelling in friendly games and choking when it matters the most.But vice-captain Dean Furman hopes that is a thing of the past. Speaking at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane after arriving on Sunday, the Bafana enforcer said the friendlies against Guinea-Bissau and Angola were good preparation for the World Cup qualifiers against Cape Verde on August 28 and September 2.Bafana will resume their quest of qualifying for the World Cup since 2002 with back-to-back fixtures against the islanders."That's the aim at the moment [to continue on the good run]. A lot of games have been friendlies, so the aim for us now is to take that form into our qualifiers," said Furman."We're using these two games as preparation for the Cape Verde game with these two countries having a lot of their players based in the Portuguese league, which is similar to Cape Verde."The preparations on Saturday [against Guinea-Bissau] went great and we hope we can do the same in the Angola game. For us it's important that we keep winning and keep building that confidence. Hopefully, there will be some more players getting a run [tonight] and keep the competition for places high."Furman described tonight's game as "very important"."Every time we put on that Bafana jersey we know we got the nation watching us. We know there's big pressure to perform, so whether it's a friendly or a competitive game, it's always important to us."And we're hoping to give our fans something to cheer about," he said.
