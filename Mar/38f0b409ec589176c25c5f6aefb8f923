AMAJITA progressed to the semifinals of the CAF U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) and automatically secured a spot at the upcoming Fifa World Cup with their 3-1 defeat of Sudan in Zambia yesterday.The victory not only confirmed a place at the South Korea global youth tournament in May but it set up a last-four meeting with hosts Zambia in Lusaka on Wednesday.Senegal - who beat Cameroon 2-0 in another group match yesterday - will take on Guinea in Ndola in another semifinal the following day."This was a major achievement and the boys have made the country proud," said Safa president Danny Jordaan yesterday."After our U-17 side qualified for the World Cup last year, it is this type of progress that has seen our Vision 2022 take immediate shape."The semis against Zambia will be a typical final before the final and the boys must look forward to this game," added Jordaan, who flew to Zambia on Saturday to give the boys moral support.Coach Thabo Senong, however, bemoaned the team's shaky defence that was again exposed by the Sudanese yesterday."We are not happy that we have conceded five goals in the group stages and this is not normal for us. Once again we will go back to the drawing board to prepare and correct our errors for the semis," said Senong.The arrival of Phakamani Mahlambi in the Amajita made an instant impact as the Bidvest Wits player combined exceptionally well with Luther Singh to give South Africa an early lead.Sudan levelled the scores through Khaled Osman, who beautifully controlled the ball with his chest before volleying it past Mondli Mpoto in the 24th minute.Amajita defence were in some stages caught napping but luckily, the match went to half-time break level at 1-1.The Mahlambi-Singh combination has the potential to be a fruitful one for the senior national team for many years to come.Singh showed great pace and selflessness as he used his pace to get behind the Sudan defence and charged into the penalty area before squaring for Mahlambi to score into an empty net.But South Africa's defence looked nervous and edgy, and Sudan found an equaliser in the simplest way when Osman fired in the equaliser unchallenged.The second stanza started well for Senong's side as they created numerous opportunities, but it was only on the hour-mark where they would restore their lead as Grant Margeman's strike put South Africa back in command.Sibongakonke Mbatha put the match to bed in the 66th minute after he was set up by Kobamelo Kodisang.South Africa beat Cameroon by the same scoreline in their pool opener, but lost 4-3 to Senegal in their second game.They will appear at the Under-20 World Cup for the third time after showings in 1997 and 2009. - Additional reporting by TMG Digital
