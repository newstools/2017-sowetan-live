Doctors tried in vain to save the life of a 16-year-old pupil who collapsed during rugby practice at a school in Pietermaritzburg.The teenager collapsed on a sports field at Alexandra High School on Wednesday afternoon. CPR had to be performed and the patient was placed on a ventilator before being transported to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg said ER24 spokesman Annine Dormehl. Doctors continued resuscitating the patient at the hospital but unfortunately nothing could be done for the teenager and the patient was declared dead just before 18h00.
