Home Affairs is looking for advanced ways to secure its systems and IDs it issues.This would in turn improve safety and security in the country, according to director-general Mkuseli Apleni, who was addressing the media yesterday about cabinet's recent decision to co-opt the department into its justice, crime prevention and security cluster.Apleni said the department was now working towards publishing a discussion paper.Public's comments on it will inform a bill that will be tabled by December 2018."Currently, this department is neither in a position to adequately defend itself from the ever-present threats such as criminal syndicates and cyber attacks," Apleni said.It was also not able to "play its full role in working with other departments in the justice, crime prevention and security cluster, in keeping the nation safe and secure at all times".One of the disadvantages of the status quo is that police cannot access the body of fingerprints Home Affairs has in its systems."Police only keep fingerprints of criminals, that's all that they keep. But Home Affairs is keeping fingerprints for everyone," Apleni pointed out. "If police rush to a crime scene, what are they going to first look for there? It's the fingerprints."Then if those systems are not integrated, to resolve that case can take many years."But if we're part of that cluster, they go to a crime scene and check a fingerprint, within 30 minutes results must be out and say this fingerprints belongs to so and so. This so and so stays in this area and then we go and arrest this person immediately," Apleni said.The move will also secure individuals' IDs and prevent fraudulent opening of accounts.Apleni blamed the insecurity of the country's passports for cancellation of visa waivers by countries like England and New Zealand to South African citizens. "If business visas we're issuing are fraudulent, who'll want to come and invest in South Africa?"The country would benefit from having a Home Affairs "that serves as the nerve centre of security and the backbone of the digital platforms our lives depend on", said the director-general. "We reiterate, the value of the services of the department is dependent on the security of its systems."nkosib@sowetan.co.za
