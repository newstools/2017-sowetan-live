Bidvest Wits raised eyebrows on Tuesday when they announced that ticket prices for Sunday's Caf Champions League showdown against Egyptian powerhouses Al Ahly at Bidvest Stadium will cost a whooping R100.Wits decision to considerably increase prices comes two weeks after soccer fans complained when Kaizer Chiefs hiked ticket prices to their Soweto derby clash against Orlando Pirates from the usual R40 to R70.The were several empty seats at FNB Stadium during the derby and given that Wits do not usually track huge crowds to BidVest their decision is a risk.It has the potential to negatively impact the gate and the club runs the risk of failing to provide an intimidating atmosphere to the Egyptian visitors. Registered club supporters and Wits University students will be exempted from the R100 charge at the gate and we are charging what we believe is a reasonable price for an official Caf match " Wits chief executive Jose Ferreira said on Tuesday."During PSL matches our registered fans and Wits students get a reduced price at the game and sometimes they don t pay at all depending on the nature of the game."When we played against Saint-Louisienne in Reunion during the preliminary stages they charged six euros at the gate which is more than R80 said Ferreira.Wits are trailing Al Ahly by an odd goal following the 1-0 first round first leg defeat to the The Red Devils in Cairo on Saturday and coach Gavin Hunt will be looking to cause a major upset by reversing the score in their favour at home. - TMG Digital
