Mariveni United's dream of beating Mamelodi Sundowns was well and truly alive going into the half-time break here last night.Going into interval at 0-0 with African champions Sundowns must have given the SAB League outfit some hope of pulling off the first shock of this season's Nedbank Cup.After all, we've seen some memorable upsets in this competition, so they had a reason to believe that a win was possible.But a second-string Sundowns side woke up from its slumber in the second period to progress to the last 16 of the "Ke Yona" competition.Sundowns, who won the tie 2-0 thanks to second-half goals from Leonardo Castro and Anthony Laffor, were poor in the first period and at times looked casual, as though they were underestimating their opponents.Laffor missed an open net in the 23rd minute, and it was the kind of chance he would bury were it a bigger game.Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane did not look impressed at all when he walked off the pitch at half-time and must have given his players a mouth full in the dressing room because they came out for the second stanza with renewed vigour.It took five minutes for the hosts to open the scoring through Colombian striker Castro, who had not scored this year before last night.He got his head on to a Teko Modise cross, just a few seconds after his headed effort was saved by Mariveni goalkeeper Hlulani Mbhumbhi, who made quite a few good saves.It was a goal Castro needed to regain his confidence.Two minutes later and Sundowns were two goals to the good, as Laffor redeemed himself for the first half blooper.He got his head onto a loose ball in the area after Castro's header came off the crossbar.Sundowns rested some of their key players for this match as the league champions had one eye on the CAF Champions League match against Ugandan outfit Kampala Capital City Authority here on Friday.l Polokwane City will host African All Stars at Peter Mokaba Stadium in the only Nedbank Cup last 32 fixture tomorrow night (7.30pm).
