The appointment of Malusi Gigaba as Finance Minister is an affirmation of the capacity the youth has, ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte said on Friday.Duarte was speaking to Africa News Network 7 (ANN7) hours after President Jacob Zuma announced his cabinet reshuffle.Zuma fired both Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas from the Finance ministry replacing them with Gigaba and Sfiso Buthelezi respectively."Gigaba of course, I think the young people are to be very excited, and are indeed very excited. All the SMSes I got from early hours of the morning was, this is really an affirmation of the capacity that the youth have and that here's a person who understands what the youth really need," said Duarte.She said that Gigaba has adequate experience as a minister and has steered the ship at two departments, Public Enterprises and until last night Home Affairs."He's been a minister twice before. So he's had two portfolios before this, this would be his third. There's no question about the fact that he is experienced as a minister. He has international experience because in both of his previous ministry he's had to deal with the international world," said Duarte.However the ANC top six is divided on the cabinet reshuffle. Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe reportedly opposed the reshuffling decision when it was presented to them last night.Ramaphosa has described the firing of Gordhan as "unacceptable".
