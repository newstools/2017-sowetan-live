Communications Minister Faith Muthambi's attempts to study for a master's degree in journalism were hit with a signal jammer when the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) sent her application to the trash bin.Muthambi, who has degrees in law and public management, had applied to be admitted into TUT's respected journalism school to pursue an M-Tech but failed to meet the institution's requirements.TUT spokeswoman Willa de Ruyter confirmed that Muthambi had applied to be admitted into the master's programme but her lack of undergraduate qualifications or experience in journalism worked against her."The minister has applied to enrol for an M-Tech in journalism but is not currently a registered student at TUT. It's a huge honour for TUT that the minister has selected this leading university to further her studies."Like any other prospective student, her application has been considered and evaluated accordingly, as set out in the TUT Prospectus."With no official qualification or previous training in journalism, the applicant did not meet the admission requirements and the minister has been informed officially of the outcome," De Ruyter said.Despite being told she did not qualify, according to City Press, Muthambi 'bulldozed' her way into TUT by continuing to attend classes although she was not a registered student.The report states that Muthambi attended the M-Tech class three times in February and the university had to write to her advising her that she could not continue attending the classes as she did not meet requirements.Additional reporting by Sowetan LIVE
