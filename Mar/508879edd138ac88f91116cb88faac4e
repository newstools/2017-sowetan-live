South Africa's feline Super Rugby teams have to deal with different foreign challenges with the Cheetahs expected to have an easy time against the Sunwolves while the Lions will be hard-pressed to avenge last year's away defeat to the Jaguares.The Jaguares game comes at the best time for the Lions early in the season where they can put aside the daunting trans-Antlantic trip and see whether they can collect points in Buenos Aires on Saturday night.It wasn't the case last year and it had far-reaching consequences in the play-offs as they were second on the overall log and had to travel to Wellington for a final they were destined to lose.Johan Ackermann's side can afford to drop points against an improving Jaguares side that dealt with the Southern Kings and narrowly lost to the Stormers in a game where their disciplinary problems came to the fore.The fact that Ackermann saw fit to leave out some of his Springboks is a sign the game is one he has written off to the loss column unless his second string tourists conjure up a win.For once the Lions are underdogs with Ackermann making nine changes from the side that mauled the Waratahs. Lock Marvin Orie will make his Lions debut alongside flyhalf Shaun Reynolds while Johannes Jonker will make his run-on debut.Harold Vorster moves from 13 to 12 in Rohan Janse van Rensburg's absence.With the Sunwolves not expected to pose much of a threat Cheetahs coach Franco Smith made five changes to the side that beat the Bulls on Saturday.Charles Marais Ntokozo Mkhabela Francois Uys Neill Jordaan and Ryno Benjamin are the personnel and positional changes.Reniel Hugo Uzair Caseem Nico Lee and Retshegofaditswe Nche paid the price for their physical exertions and will missing through injury.Willie Britz will be making a return to the ground where made his name as a Super Rugby starter with the Cheetahs.Jaguares: TBALions: 15 Jaco van der Walt 14 Courtnall Skosan 13 Jacques Nel 12 Harold Vorster 11 Anthony Volmink 10 Shaun Reynolds 9 Ross Cronj 8 Warren Whiteley (captain) 7 Cyle Brink 6 Albertus Smith 5 Marvin Orie 4 Andries Ferreira 3 Johannes Jonker 2 Robbie Coetzee 1 Dylan Smith.Replacements: 16 Malcolm Marx 17 Jacques van Rooyen 18 Ruan Dreyer 19 Lourens Erasmus 20 Jaco Kriel 21 Francois de Klerk 22 Andries Coetzee 23 Sylvian Mahuza.Cheetahs: 15 Clayton Blommetjies 14 Zee Mkhabela 13 Ryno Benjamin 11 Raymond Rhule 10 Fred Zeilinga 9 Tian Meyer 8 Neill Jordaan 7 Teboho Mohoje 6 Paul Schoeman 5 Francois Uys 4 Justin Basson 3 Johan Coetzee 2 Torsten van Jaarsveld 1 Charles MaraisReplacements: 16 Elandre Huggett 17 Danie Mienie 18 Tom Botha 19 Armandt Koster 20 Henco Venter 21 Niel Marais 22 Ali Mgijima 23 Ruan van RensburgSunwolves: 15 Shota Emi 14 Takaaki Nakazuru 13 William Tupou 12 Derek Carpenter 11 Kenki Fukuoka 10 Hayden Cripps 9 Keisuke Uchida 8 Willem Britz 7 Shuhei Matsuhashi 6 Edward Quirk 5 Uwe Helu 4 Liaki Moli 3 Yasuo Yamaji 2 Yusuke Niwai 1 Kkoki Yamamoto.Replacements: 16 Atsushi Sakate 17 Masataka Mikami 18 Takuma Asahara 19 Sam Wykes 20 Shokei Kin 21 Kaito Shigeno 22 Jumpei Ogura 23 Jamie-Jerry Taulagi. - TNG Digital
