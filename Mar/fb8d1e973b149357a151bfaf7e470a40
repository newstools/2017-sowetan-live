ANC's Eastern Cape provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane has sharply criticised the party officials that presided over the election of Andile Lungisa as the ANC chairman of Nelson Mandela Bay region and said they have failed the organisation and caused unnecessary tensions.Mabuyane was speaking after the organisation's NEC ordered Lungisa to step down as the regional chairman."The officials that oversaw the election of comrade Lungisa failed the organisation and caused unnecessary tensions because they had the constitution of the ANC there, all that they were supposed to do was to affirm it."The matter was not supposed to be allowed to happen, it was not meant to happen because now it has personalised the decisions of the organisation and as party secretaries we always bear the brunt because we are the ones that are making sure that the constitution of the organisation is respected."Mabuyane said the NEC did not do anything new on this matter except affirming old ANC principle, based on its constitution. The NEC ruling also casts shades of doubts on the status of Nelson Mandela Bay regional executive.
