Western Cape MEC for Economic Opportunities and avid cyclist Alan Winde has commended the organisers for the "management of a difficult situation" after they cancelled the Cape Town Cycle Tour on Sunday.Images of strong winds almost ripping bicycles from the hands of cyclists at the start of the race in Cape Town have flooded the internet. Thousands of people were forced to go home when organisers decided to can the event due to the winds.Winde said the call to cancel the 40th edition of the tour was carefully considered and it was the most responsible approach under the circumstances."I am proud of the team for taking a hard decision in the interests of all participants. Organisers have also donated goods intended for the event to the communities affected by devastating fires in Hout Bay " said Winde."I'd like to acknowledge the public for their support in assisting residents impacted by the fires. It was encouraging to see several companies and residents offer donations."The fire in Hout Bay on Saturday claimed the lives of 10 people and affected approximately 15 000.On Monday spokesperson for the city's disaster risk management centre Charlotte Powell said the rehabilitation process was underway."Debris has been removed by Solid Waste 90% of water has been restored.
