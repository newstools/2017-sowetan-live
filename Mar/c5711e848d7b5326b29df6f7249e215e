If there was a time when Kaizer Chiefs were in a better position to beat their rivals Orlando Pirates, this is it.Not only are Pirates winless in 10 matches, but they also have a new coach, Kjell Jonevret, who is in his second week with the club and still trying to get the players to understand his philosophy.According to Komphela, it will be interesting to see if Bucs players have grasped Jonevret's philosophy and can remain organised for the full 90 minutes. Chiefs, therefore, could take advantage and claim the bragging rights at FNB tomorrow ."You can't take advantage. Orlando Pirates remain Orlando Pirates," differed a diplomatic Komphela. "So yes, the [new] coach will come in and I'm sure in his submissions, he's been talking about organisation."You know how the Europeans are; they are big on defensive organisation and also structuring the team going forward. How quick the Pirates players grasp that and if they have, how long can it last in a match?"So it is a question of time whether they have grasped [Jonevret's philosophy], and we will just have to manage that," said Komphela.He was equally diplomatic when assessing the two teams' contrasting forms. Chiefs are unbeaten in seven games, while Pirates are going through a bad patch. "We respect Pirates and whatever they went through is gone. There is a new coach and it is a new match," he added.Amakhosi goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune also doesn't believe Pirates are there for the taking."We cannot go there thinking we are just going to have a walk in the park," Khune warned.Khune, however, said fourth-placed Chiefs will go all out for a win especially since they are very much in contention of the title. "We are going into the derby in a better position in the league and if we win, we are back on top."
