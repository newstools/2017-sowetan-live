Anaso Jobodwana overcame a disastrous start as he showed his top-end speed was back snatching victory in the 100m in Durban on Tuesday night. He clocked a tame 10.21 seconds in the opening meet of the Athletics SA Speed Series at King s Park stadium even with a massive tail wind of 3.9 seconds to beat Emile Erasmus who was second at 0.07sec behind.Jobodwana the 2015 world championship bronze medallist in the 200m struggled with injury last year and raced only once a forgettable performance in the 200m heats at the Rio Olympics.His top-end speed was lacking horribly then but on Tuesday night he displayed a flash of his potential. It was not good he admitted afterwards saying he had been practising block starts for only a week. Still my block starts added Jobodwana who claimed the 100m and 200m double at the World Student Games. I just said I m going to run the race and then go back to the drawing board. I m not too fazed but obviously I must step it up. I m just happy to be back in the mindset. Jobodwana said he was feeling no ill effects of the pubic bone injury that ruined his 2016. I ve been training for three months without any hindrance. Elroy Gelant won the men s 10 000m in 28min 16.54sec and declared he was happy with where he was in his build-up to the African cross-country championships in Uganda at the end of March.Gelant who clocked his 27:41.30 personal best in Durban four years ago said he was still busy working on endurance which meant the speed was still to come.Justine Palframan had to work hard to beat Gena Lofstrand in the women s 400m.Lofstrand an 800m runner doing some speed work led for the first 350m before Olympian Palframan hauled her in.Lofstrand was chuffed with her 54.25 personal best but Palframan was disappointed with her 54.13. I m not happy about the time but I got through it said the Maties sprinter who has had a few niggles recently. I was too slow on the back straight and I let Gena control the race early on. I should have attacked earlier. The men s 1500m ended in a sprint finish with Jerry Motsau a World Student Games bronze medallist from 2013 edging Nkosinathi Sibiya by 0.15sec.His 3:40.54 was well short of the 3:36.00 world championship qualifying standard.Dumisani Hlaselo who competed at the 2015 world championships was a disappointing 10th more than nine seconds off the pace.Promising Tuks student George Kusche who recently clocked the fastest SA junior best for the 1000m although it isn t official produced another impressive performance slashing some 12 seconds off his personal best to place fourth in 3:41.18.- TMG Digital/Sunday Times
