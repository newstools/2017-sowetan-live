Orlando Pirates face the prospect of extending their club record winless run in the Premier Soccer League to 12 matches when they face SuperSport United at the Orlando Stadium on Tuesday night but that is where it should end with a Nedbank Cup Last 32 clash against minnow opposition at the weekend.Prior to this season Pirates previous worst run without a win in the PSL was seven games a fate that befell them on three occasions in the 2007/08 2009/10 and 2012/13 campaigns.But Saturday s Soweto Derby draw with Kaizer Chiefs means they have now not won since a 1-0 success at Chippa United on November 22.And coming up against a SuperSport side who are undefeated in their last 18 league games since an opening day 1-0 loss at Platinum Stars the cards looked very much stacked against The Buccaneers.SuperSport have also had the better of their opponents in recent times with four of their last five meetings resulting in victory and the other game drawn.Part of that run includes the infamous 6-1 victory in November that spelled the end for coach Muhsin Ertugral though their last match was a 1-0 Telkom Knockout victory later in the month.Pirates have not defeated SuperSport since a 4-1 win almost two years ago when Menzi Masuku now at Chippa United bagged a brace.Kermit Erasmus and Sifiso Myeni got the other goals with all of those players now having left the team.Should Pirates fail to get victory again tonight they will extend their winless record to 12 games but have high hopes of ending the horror run when they travel to East London to face ABC Motsepe League side EC Bees in the Nedbank Cup Last 32.The fixture may conjure memories of a 4-1 loss to Maluti FET College at the same stage of the competition in 2013 but another defeat to lower league opposition would take this already dismal 2016/17 season to a new low. - TMG Digital
