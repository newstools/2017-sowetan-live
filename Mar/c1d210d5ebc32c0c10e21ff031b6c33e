But a police officer in court said it was unlikely the matter would be enrolled due to a lack of evidence. There was also no clarity from the state prosecutor on whether the accused would take the stand.Natasha Ramkissoon-Kara a spokeswoman for the National Prosecuting Authority in KwaZulu-Natal was not immediately available for comment.Bonginkosi was shot dead on Sunday morning while plucking guavas from a tree. He sustained injuries in the upper body and head. His body was taken to a mortuary for a post-mortem. A licensed shot gun belonging to the suspect was seized by the police as an exhibit.
