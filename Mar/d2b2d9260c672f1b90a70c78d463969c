The Bulls were expected to lose to the Blues in their Super Rugby clash at the QBE Stadium in North Habour on Saturday but not to be obliterated 38-14 for their third loss of the campaign after four starts.It looked promising at half-time for the visitors as the score was tied at 7-7 when they went to the break but the hosts came back stronger and more determined to score five tries to earn a bonus point.Blues victory was ensured by a brace of tries from wing Matt Duffie and one each from scrumhalf Augustine Pulu wing Melani Nanai flyhalf Ihaia West and hooker Matt Moulds with two conversions from starting fly-half Piers Francis and one from West.Lizo Gqoboka and replacement scrumhalf Rudi Paige scored Bulls two tries while flyhalf Handre Pollard and his replacement Tian Schoeman added one conversion each but it was not enough to stop the rampaging Blues.The Bulls struggled despite the fact that they had the numerical advantage in the 59th minute when Jimmy Tupou was sent to the bin and they will have to improve dramatically against the Chiefs next weekend.ScorersBluesTries: Pulu Duffie (2) West Moulds NanaiConversions: Francis 2 WestBulls:Tries: Gqoboka PaigeConversions: Pollard T Schoeman - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
