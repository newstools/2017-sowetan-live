Two local entrepreneurs who bought a racing pigeon for a world record R5-million say they did it to attract fame, fortune and respect."We bought Golden Prince to get access to his genetics; from a marketing point of view, to get worldwide exposure because everybody knows you are serious players," said Mark Kitchenbrand, owner of Kitchenbrand, which breeds pigeons for racing."The third reason is to get a return on investment because we can sell the babies. It is going to take us up to two years to get our money back and after that we are going to earn a lot of money," he said.Kitchenbrand acquired the male pigeon together with Samuel Mbiza. Kitchenbrand said they each forked out half of R 5-million for Golden Prince . Kitchenbrand spoke on behalf of Mbiza who declined to be interviewed. He said Mbiza's aim was to take pigeon racing into townships and grow the sport."His ambition is to put up pigeon lofts in Soweto, start a club and teach [kids] the sport."Kitchenbrand, who used to run a company selling photocopying machines, said prior to 2006 the country did not have pigeons with the best genetics for racing. He now generates most of his income from pigeon breeding and racing.Kitchenbrand's pigeon farm in Alberton boasts more than 100 trophies won from various domestic and international pigeon-racing competitions.One such competition is the R13-million challenge which had, until last year, been taking place in Sun City. He once bought a world-famous pigeon called Birdie for R800000.Eight years later he sold Birdie for R1.1-million and generated more than R9-million from selling Birdie's babies.
