Defeat is not an option for stablemates Rofhiwa "War Child" Maemu and Jeff "911" Magagane, who will be in action at Blairgowrie Recreation Centre in Randburg on Sunday afternoon.This stern warning was issued by their trainer Alan Toweel Junior yesterday. Toweel also made it clear that the Sowetans were in a must-win situation. "There are bigger plans in store for them," said Toweel, who will be shouting instructions in corners of his charges against Siphiwe Nsangani and Ayanda Nkosi respectively.Maemu's bout against Nsangani will be a non-title six-rounder in the featherweight class, while Magagane will bid for the first defence of his Gauteng lightweight title over 10 rounds.Toweel wants both Maemu from Tshiawelo and Magagane from Freedom Park to challenge for the SA titles. The featherweight belt is held by BSA 2016 Prospect of the Year award winner Azinga "Golden Boy" Fuzile.Toweel does not want Magagane to challenge legendary Mzonke Fana, who holds the national lightweight strap.Instead, he wants him to challenge SA junior welterweight champ Warren Joubert. Magagane is rated No 5 in the lightweight class. "Azinga is good but Rofhiwa has got the style for him," said Toweel. "I honestly believe that Jeff has the beating of Warren."Toweel's other charges who will also be in action are Percy Mkhize, Hloni Maboko, Sifiso Hlongwane, Faraday Mukandila and Chris Monyai. Mkhize will face Nyelisani Thagambega, while Maboko will fight Luvo Ntlebi. Hlongwane will take on Tyrone Murgatroyd, while Mukandila and Siyabonga Mabena will meet in the welterweight class.Monyai will take on John Bopape. Action starts at 1.30pm.
