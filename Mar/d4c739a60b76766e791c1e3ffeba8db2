Had Kaizer Chiefs won the Soweto Derby on Saturday, it would have been difficult for Orlando Pirates players to meet up the following day to prepare for today's clash with SuperSport United, according to Bucs coach Kjell Jonevret.Saturday' s 1-1 draw against their rivals means Jonevret did not have to pick players up from a defeat, instead he is building on the result as Bucs look to break an 11-game winless streak tonight at Orlando Stadium (7.30pm).Jonevret has drawn his first two Premiership matches and is hoping the third would come with a victory to enhance Pirates' chances of finishing in the top eight."It's a tough one because both teams played [on Saturday] and only three days later we play again. So we will see which team has recovered best, but at the same time the players are used to this," said Jonevret."Had it been 2-1 [to Chiefs] in the derby, then it would have been tough to meet on Sunday. The players can see that they played a good game and that we are going somewhere."In Stuart Baxter, Jonevret comes up against a man he knows from his coaching days in Sweden.In the other match tonight, Platinum Stars will be looking for a third straight victory when they host Golden Arrows at Royal Bafokeng Stadium (7.30pm).
