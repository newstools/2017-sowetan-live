The South African Communist Party (SACP) have said that the sudden resignation of Brian Molefe as the chief executive of Eskom raised questions.SACP's deputy General Secretary Solly Mapaila said that it did not make sense for Molefe to resign out of his own will from a position where he earned millions.Molefe resigned from his position in November 2016 shortly after former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela released her report into allegations of state capture mainly by the controversial Gupta family.Molefe's relationship with the Guptas also formed part of the report which showed he visited the family's Saxonwold mansion 44 times in seven months between August 2015 and March 2016.He was in early 2017 sworn in as African National Congress (ANC) member of parliament."Questions around Comrade Brian Molefe arise when he resigned out of his own will. No one forced to resign. You work in the media you know possibly how much a CEO of Eskom earns. Amongst the highest earners in the country, several millions I guess.""He left there to go and take a parliamentary seat that is worth less than R1.5million from the several many millions that he was getting from Eskom," said Mapaila.Mapaila added that they believe Molefe was pressured to resign following the State of Capture report which suggested he had propelled state funds to the Gupta family and their businesses."[Which is] something that should not have ever happened. Actually he must account for it. That action, he must account for it."Molefe has reportedly been tipped to take over from Pravin Gordhan as the Finance Minister when President Jacob Zuma announces his reshuffle. A move the SACP has objected to officially as the part of the tripartite alliance.
