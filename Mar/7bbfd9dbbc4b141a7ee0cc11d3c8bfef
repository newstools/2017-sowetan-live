Cape Town City forward Lebogang Manyama won the Absa Premiership s player of the month award for February on Wednesday and Pitso Mosimane of Mamelodi Sundowns won coach of the month.Manyama currently the PSL s joint-top scorer with Orlando Pirates Zimbabwean forward Tendai Ndori on 11 goals becomes only the second player to win four player of the month awards within a single season. I don t think I would have done this without my team Manyama said. I think the way Cape Town City have played in the second round is probably the reason for this award. The first four winners of the new R5 000 prize for the Absa Premiership Goal of the Month competition the finalists of which go into the PSL s Goal of the Year award were named.They were Marc van Heerden (August/September then with Chippa United) George Lebese (October Kaizer Chiefs) Oscarine Masukulupe (November Baroka FC) and Percy Tau (December Sundowns).The awards were presented at the PSL offices in Parktown.February Player of the Month: Lebogang Manyama (four times in one season)February Coach of the Month: Pitso MosimaneAbsa Premiership Goal of the month:August/September: Marc van Heerden Baroka FC 1 Chippa United 2 Peter Mokaba Stadium September 28October: George Lebese Kaizer Chiefs 2 Ajax Cape Town 0 Moses Mabhida Stadium October 15November: Oscarine Masukulupe Orlando Pirates 1 Baroka FC 1 Orlando Stadium November 30December: Percy Tau Mamelodi Sundowns 4 Free State Stars 1 Loftus Versfeld - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
