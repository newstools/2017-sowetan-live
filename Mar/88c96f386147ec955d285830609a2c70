Delron Buckley has given insight into the feud he had with Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela three years ago.The two had a very public falling out in 2014 after Buckley s contract was not renewed by KwaZulu-Natal club Maritzburg United while Komphela was still the head coach.The 39-year old Buckley said at the weekend he has put the incident behind him."In my last year at Maritzburg they signed Steve Komphela. And it just didn't click between us he said."I'm sure you guys read in the papers what happened."But I don't hold grudges with anyone because that's football."He came and we didn't get on and I moved on."But the saddest thing is that when my contract ended at Maritzburg I didn't get any offers."I got in contact with a few clubs and they weren't interested. So what can you do?"In South Africa we have this mentality that at 35 a player cannot play any more. But why? In Europe there are players still playing at 36 or 37."The age shouldn't matter. Shoes Moshoes was still buzzing at Chiefs [at 40]."Buckley was speaking at the launch of his book "Delron Buckley My Life" in Durban on Friday morning. TMG Digital/TMG Sport
