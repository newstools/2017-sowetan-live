Bafana Bafana extended their matches without a loss to 17 last night when they were held to an exciting 0-0 draw by Angola in East London.The encounter proved to be a game of two halves as Angola dominated in the first while the home side came back stronger after the break.Bafana made nine changes from the side that beat Guinea-Bissau 3-1 in Durban at the weekend, with nine of the players in the starting XI playing in the domestic league.SA had their first chance five minutes into the game when Phakamani Mahlambi combined well with Percy Tau, but the Mamelodi Sundowns man failed to pick a teammate in the box.Angola winger Manuel David Afonso was a constant threat on the left and managed to get the better of Diamond Thopola a couple of times in the first half.The slow Angola defenders could not deal with the pacey Bafana forwards as they committed a number of fouls deep in their own half. But the home side failed to capitalise from the set pieces.While Bafana dominated, the visitors had the first shot on target when captain Adriano Belmiro Duarte Nicolau cut back inside from the left but Darren Keet made a save.Caretaker coach Owen da Gama introduced his more experienced campaigners in Ramahle Mphahlele, Keagan Dolly, Thulani serero and Themba Zwane in place of Lebohang Manyama and debutants Thopola, Luther Singh and Mahlambi immediately after the break.
