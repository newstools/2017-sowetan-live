Swedish-based rising star Mihlali Mayambela made just his third start for top side Djurgarden as they beat Helsingborg 1-0 in the country s domestic cup competition at the weekend.Mihlali who is the younger brother of Ajax Cape Town s Mark Mayambela another former Djurgarden player featured in the full game for the side for the second time since joinng the club in January 2016.It is a sign that the 20-year-old is making progress at the team and he will hope 2017 is his breakthrough year with more regular game-time at what is one of the top sides in Sweden.Despite the win Djurgarden have been knocked out of the cup the early stages of which are played in a round-robin format and they start their league campaign on April 3.Keagan Dolly was a substitute for the final 15 minutes of Montpellier s 1-1 draw with Guingamp in Ligue 1 while a division below Kermit Erasmus started for Lens as they won 3-2 at Red Star but was withdrawn early in the second half.All four of South Africa s major stars in Belgium had to settle for a place on the bench this weekend though it did mean a return to favour of sorts for Ayanda Patosi at Lokeren.He has fallen out with the club over a new contract and has not played for them since early November though perhaps his place on the bench is a sign of thawing tensions.Andile Jali (Oostende) Lars Veldwijk (Kortrijk) and Ntuthuko Radebe (Eupen) were unused substitutes.Bongani Zungu played for Vitoria Guimaraes as they earned a very credible 1-1 draw at Sporting Lisbon in the Portuguese league while Kamohelo Mokotjo turned out for FC Twente as they beat Willem II in Holland.Lehlogonolo Msalesa played for his Greek side Larissa in a 1-1 draw against PAS Giannina and Dino Ndlovu featured for Qarabag in the Azerbaijan league as they won 4-0 against Sumqayi.Lebogang Phiri was forced off on 41 minutes for Brondby in their 3-2 defeat at home to Nordsj lland and he will hope the injury is not too serious.Finally South African Under-23 international Tyroane Sandows started for Gremio in their Primeira Liga 1-1 draw with Ceara in Brazil.Despite its lofty title the Primeira Liga is a competition that features teams from Brazil s southern region and was started in 2016 as a way to boost TV revenue.Gremio field mostly a second-string team in the competition. - TMG Digital
