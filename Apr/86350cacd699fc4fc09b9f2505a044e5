The prayers of some Yeoville community members were answered on Sunday when Johannesburg metro police silenced a noisy illegal church by confiscating its musical instruments and speakers.Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said metro cops came to the church after repeated complaints of noise from community members in the Johannesburg suburb. The pastor was warned to stop making a noise and to stop using residential property as a church. He continued to defy the officers and ignored complaints from the surrounding community by making lots of noise (during) weekdays and over weekends said Minnaar.The JMPD arrived with a van on Sunday morning and loaded the church s drums loud speakers an amplifier and chairs meant for the congregation. The pastor will have to pay R2 650 if he wants to retrieve it from the JMPD pound and if these items are not fetched within 30 days it will automatically become state property in terms of City by-law regulations Minnaar said.
