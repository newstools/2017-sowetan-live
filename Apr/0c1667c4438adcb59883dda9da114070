Former Mamelodi Sundowns and Bafana Bafana midfielder Papi Mbele, 38, now works for Sedtrade, a company constructing a tar road in the small town of Heilbron.When Sunday World paid him a surprise visit this week, Mbele said he regretted his decision of leaving Sundowns in a huff despite being advised otherwise by former owner Nastasia Tsichlas.A week after he left the club and joined Moroka Swallows, it was announced that Patrice Motsepe had bought the club."When my contract was left with six months at the beginning of 2002, I called my boss Nastasia and asked her if she was going to renew my contract or not. She advised me to chill as she was in Greece for two months and said we would finalise everything when she came back."
