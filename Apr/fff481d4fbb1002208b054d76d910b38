Threats against a Cape Flats school principal materialised on Wednesday when he was stabbed repeatedly by two people.The incident took place at the Bishops School of Skills in Bishop Lavis. According to a joint statement issued by Education MEC Debbie Schaffer and head of her department Brian Schreuder Wayne Abrahams received threats after he instituted disciplinary action against a pupil who allegedly shot a 15-year-old boy at the school. The shooting was allegedly gang related. Abrahams reported that he had been warned against proceeding with the disciplinary hearing. On Wednesday two people gained access to the school before 7pm and accosted Abrahams in the foyer. He was allegedly stabbed multiple times in the head neck shoulder and chest . We condemn this vicious attack in the strongest possible terms. Any attack on a teacher or a principal is completely unacceptable Schaffer and Schreuder said in the statement. An attack such as this on someone who is dedicating his life to uplifting the youth of this province and who is trying to do the right thing by taking disciplinary action to protect his learners shows how warped some peoples values are. We are currently monitoring the principal s condition.
