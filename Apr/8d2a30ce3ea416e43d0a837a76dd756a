National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete has agreed to postpone the debate and vote on the motion of no confidence next week against President Jacob Zuma.Parliament said in a statement on Wednesday evening that her decision was made after a request by the Democratic Alliance under whose leader the motion was tabled . Opposition parties lobbied for the postponement pending a decision by the Constitutional Court on an application by the United Democratic Movement (UDM) seeking a ruling on whether the vote of no confidence can be done by a secret ballot. The postponement of the motion will be referred to the National Assembly Programme Committee for its consideration after the constituency period said the statement.The decision comes after a day of wrangling over the postponement between Mbete and DA leader Mmusi Maimane. Maimane and his chief whip John Steenhuisen repeatedly emphasised that they were not asking for a withdrawal but rather a postponement.
