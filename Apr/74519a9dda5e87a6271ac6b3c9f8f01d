He is seven but resembles a three-year-old. The little boy is blind and cannot walk or talk. And while his mother, 28, was anxious about whether or not she would get his disability grant yesterday, he did not understand a thing."I got all his money. It would have been difficult for us to get through the month without it. I use it to buy food, pay rent and diapers for him," said his mother who collected her son's R1600 grant at Ipelegeng Community Hall in White City Jabavu, Soweto. "He cannot do anything by himself. I have to bathe, feed and take him outside for some fresh air."He was born like this and cannot play with children his age." Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini visited some paypoints in Soweto yesterday to ensure the smooth running of payouts to thousands of beneficiaries.Over the past few weeks, there was uncertainty on whether grant payments would go through or not. The South African Social Security Agency's contract with Cash Paymaster Services was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court in 2014. More than 17million citizens depend on social grants countrywide.Dlamini said: "Since Friday, we have paid out R3.3-billion to 6million beneficiaries across the country. We would like to once again apologise for what happened," she said.Another beneficiary, Salome Mailula, 83, from Diepkloof, said she was not worried about whether the money would be paid out or not. "The minister assured us that we would get the money and I knew she would deliver. I used to get my pension at the bank but there were times when I would go there and would be told that it was not deposited. Since I started coming here, I have not had any problems," Mailula said.A total of R73.5-million is paid out to 67131 beneficiaries in the township every month.Street hawker Idah Kgwele said she hoped the system would not be changed. "If beneficiaries go to the banks to collect money, I will suffer. This is how I make a living." Kgwele said.
