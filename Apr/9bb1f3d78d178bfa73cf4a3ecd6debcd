The man accused of stabbing a Soweto principal more than 25 times has fired his lawyer, citing his failure to help him. I want him to refund my money because he failed to help me Oriah Molapo, 45, appeared in the Lenasia Regional Court yesterday where he was to hear when his trial would start after the case was postponed twice last month.However, defence lawyer Peter Shilane told the court that he was withdrawing his services after Molapo expressed unhappiness with the way he was representing him. And it seemed that Molapo was not willing to let Shilane just walk away scot-free."I want him to refund my money because he failed to help me ... Mr Shilane must give me back my money so that I can look for another lawyer," he said.Molapo was denied bail by the same court in December after it found that the case against him was "overwhelming" to grant him bail. He is facing charges of attempted murder and malicious damage to property after allegedly stabbing Nomathemba Lebepe at Paul Mosaka Primary School in Pimville, Soweto, in November. It is alleged they had been at loggerheads for years over Molapo's fake qualifications when he was still a teacher at the school.Last month, Molapo came face-to-face with Lebepe for the first time in court since the attack. She was in court again yesterday.The court told Molapo that he needed to find another lawyer so his trial can start as investigations have been concluded. The court also told him it would not get involved in his refund battle with Shilane as this was out of its scope. But Molapo was advised that if he does not have money to pay for a private attorney he could get legal aid.The case was postponed to next week when Molapo is expected to present his new lawyer.
