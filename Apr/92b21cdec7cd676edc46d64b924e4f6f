South African youngster Mihlali Mayambela recently made his debut for Swedish second-tier side Degerfors where he will spend 2017 on loan from top-flight Djurgardens as he seeks to kick-start his career in Europe.Mayambela and his parent club have both suggested that the quieter surroundings of the industrial town with a population of a little over 7 000 will help him focus on his football without distraction.Dropping a division is not ideal for the 20-year-old but he can point to the example of new Bafana Bafana cap Luther Singh as someone who used the Swedish Superetten as a springboard to much bigger things during 18 months at GAIS.Mayambela made his debut in a 3-2 win at Syrianska and recently said he was excited for his new adventure. I m looking forward to a season in Degerfors " Mayambela said."It s a small town and a new environment for me so I am grateful that they want to invest in me. I want to thank Djurgarden for agreeing to this and for giving me this opportunity."Playing matches is the key to develop as a player to play games continuously will make me a better football player."I will try to go up by 110 percent in everything I do and I think I have a chance to work hard now and enjoy football. It [Degerfors] is a small town and a smaller team so we will have to push hard all the time to achieve results."I look forward to this and hopefully I will be able to develop into a better football player. Djurgardens sporting director Bosse Andersson hinted that moving away from the bright lights of Stockholm was a positive move for Mayambela. There will be a quiet good environment for him where he can get a nice development and focus fully on football Andersson said.Mayambela who is the younger brother of Ajax Cape Town winger Mark who also played for Djurgardens moved to Sweden in January 2016 having impressed while on trial from National First Division side Cape Town All Stars.He made two starts and seven substitute appearances in 2016 netting his maiden goal in a cup victory over lower league Smedby. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
