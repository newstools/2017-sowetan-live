Ex-Moroka Swallows captain Lefa Tsutsulupa says he is not surprised to see the Dube Birds suffer their third consecutive relegation.The one-time Soweto giants dropped from the ABC Motsepe League to the fourth division following a 2-1 loss to Orange Vaal Professionals at the weekend.Swallows' demotion to the SAB league did not surprise Tsutsulupa, who played 235 games for the Birds between 2005 and 2015. "It was a sad day for football, but I would be lying if I say I was shocked."When you run a team in a way some Swallows bosses I can't mention did, this is what happens," Tsutsulupa told Sowetan yesterday, adding that "some people must take full responsibility for this"."When you are working with people you must be professional, the club lacked professionalism at some aspects. Maybe it needed to die so that it can be started afresh by efficient and committed people," he said."In football miracles happen. I am positive that maybe we will see the team coming back in the future. It will not be easy because they are in the SAB League now and it will take many stages to come up.''
