The Absa Premiership is anybody's to win.This is the view of Bidvest Wits captain Thulani Hlatshwayo, a sentiment he shared with Kaizer Chiefs vice-skipper Siphiwe Tshabalala, seated side by side at the awards presentation at the PSL offices in Johannesburg yesterday.Hlatshwayo was named Premiership Player of the Month for March, while Tshabalala's free-kick against Free State Stars was voted the best goal for February.The pair also paid tribute to coach of the month (for March), Cape Town City's Eric Tinkler, who was absent, citing ill-health."It's going to be anybody's league because it is not about the big teams; you have a team like Cape Town City, in their first season [in top flight], also challenging strongly."But] I believe we have the endurance to push all the way," said Hlatshwayo, who will lead the Clever Boys' against Golden Arrows in Premiership match at Bidvest Stadium tonight (7.30pm).Wits have the league crown to chase after they were eliminated from the Nedbank Cup.They are also facing an uphill battle going into the return leg of their CAF Confederation Cup assignment after they were held to a goalless draw by Smouha of Egypt at the weekend."It was a shared ambition to contest all trophies, including the league title, but unfortunately some results did not go our way," Hlatshwayo said.Tonight, Hlatshwayo and company will face an Arrows side that has been grinding out positive results across all competitions, including their shock elimination of Mamelodi Sundowns in the Nedbank Cup at the weekend.
