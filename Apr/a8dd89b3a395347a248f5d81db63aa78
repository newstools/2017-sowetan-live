The embers of discontent were unmistakable in the stands at FNB Stadium on Saturday night and Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela will be desperate to prevent them from blowing up into a flame in the coming days.Chiefs defeat to SuperSport United in the quarterfinals of the Nedbank Cup at the 2010 World Cup final venue will have suddenly turned the screws on the coach as the league title now represents the last chance for silverware for AmaKhosi this season.Komphela has led a pretty charmed life since the beginning of the year and has not had to deal with the angry fans who attended Chiefs games hellbent on making life difficult for him towards the end of last year.The Chiefs coach will want to give assures that he still has things very much under control when his charges travel to the Mother City to face leaders Cape Town City in a tricky must-win league match at Cape Town Stadium on Tuesday night.The third-placed Chiefs are a point behind the leaders and a victory in Cape Town will go a long way towards calming the grumblings that greeted the defeat to Supersport.Given that Chiefs face the possibility of finishing a second season in a row without winning a trophy and City are starting to believe they can win a maiden league title Tuesday night s showdown could be an explosive affair.Komphela conceded that the trip to Cape Town would not be a walk in the park given City s tenacity under coach Eric Tinkler. They are lethal on the transition. They are set up nicely and they know how to screen and once the get the ball they come straight at you he said. So that s one thing that you need to be careful about. And we need to be careful that our game model does not play into their hands. We know that on transitions they will punish you like they have never seen goalposts before. Fellow title challengers Bidvest Wits (second on the standings) and Mamelodi Sundowns (fourth) will all be in action on a night where even a draw could prove costly to the chasing sides.As Komphela himself rightfully pointed a couple of days ago It's squeaky bum time.
