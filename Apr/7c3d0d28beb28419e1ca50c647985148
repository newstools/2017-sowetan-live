SuperSport United midfielder Reneilwe "Yeye" Letsholonyane insists that coach Stuart Baxter's imminent departure has not affected the team.Baxter has for the past few weeks been linked with the vacant Bafana Bafana coaching post, but Letsholonyane said all was normal in the camp ahead of their clash against Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Stadium this evening (6pm)."We hear news about coaches and players [leaving] on a daily basis. It is a part of our lives and football."So it doesn't [affect us] and that's his [Baxter's] business. As things stand, he is our coach and we work with him everyday. Our focus is on what we do at training and winning games," stated Letsholonyane.Yeye warned that the fact that the Brazilians have not won a match in their last five matches doesn't mean Matsatsantsa will have it easy considering that this is a derby clash.The two sides are separated by two points, though Sundowns have two games in hand. "On any day they can beat any team. We know we are playing a very good team and we respect that," cautioned Letsholonyane."But in saying that, we are also working hard in trying to win the game. We also want to win the league."SuperSport's title ambitions were dealt a big blow when they lost 1-0 to Baroka in their last league outing earlier this month, but Letsholonyane said they have put it behind them."We went 19 games without a loss and we can take that defeat as men, go back to the drawing board and try to bounce back on Thursday [today]," he added confidently.
