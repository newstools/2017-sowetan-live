The spirit and never-say-die attitude shown by Cape Town City players in sneaking a dramatic win over Kaizer Chiefs on Tuesday and staying top of the table could prove the catalyst to go on and win the Premier Soccer League title said coach Eric Tinkler. I was not impressed with our defensive performance and if the truth be told we were a little fortunate to come away with all three points he said.Judas Moseamedi s stoppage time header handed City a 3-2 win at the Cape Town Stadium in a pulsating end-to-end game. But the never-say-die attitude and character that the boys have you can t fault them for that. That is a big positive. Asked whether that might prove the ingredient for City in their very first season to go on and win the title with five games left to play Tinkler added: Definitely I think. The spirit there was phenomenal. You can win a league like that. Tinkler called the win over Chiefs a six pointer . We ve opened up a little gap but the league race remains so tight."Now we need to get the players back down to earth to start working on our next match against Maritzburg."This result (against Chiefs) will mean nothing if we don t get a result against Maritzburg."We have the opportunity of a lifetime but we need each player to concentrate for the next 30 days and work hard putting aside everything else."In the next 30 days we will either make it or not."That s the harsh reality. City are away at Maritzburg on Monday and then finish their campaign with matches against Free State Stars (home May 5) SuperSport United (away May 9) Golden Arrows (home May 17) and Polokwane City (away) on May 27. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
