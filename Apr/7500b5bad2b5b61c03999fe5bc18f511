Gordon Igesund remains positive that Highlands Park will survive relegation.He said his team was just unlucky not to have bagged maximum points against Orlando Pirates on Saturday."We are under pressure based on our position on the log, but look at the points that separates teams from number six down to 16."It's two points, so I am saying there is pressure for all these teams."We just need two wins and we will be home and dry," said Igesund after the goalless draw against Pirates.The point moved Highlands from the basement to 15th spot on a better goal difference above Baroka.The two are level on 21 points."If it was not for our poor shooting, we would have been at least four goals up in the first half," said Igesund in reference to the Pirates, who were also also saved by the crossbar following a Franklin Cale's free kick.Highlands will enjoy a week's rest before they host Bloemfontein Celtic in two weeks' time.Against Pirates, Igesund's side ran rings around the Buccaneers for the better part of their well-attended fixture at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Saturday, only to be let down by poor execution in the final third."Sometimes we seem to take a breather towards the end of our games and that is when we get punished."We will need to perfect our shooting," said the coach, who has promised to unleash striker Collins Mbesuma who was on the bench for the second time since he recovered from a knee injury.Highlands's remaining Absa Premiership matches are against Celtic, Bidvest Wits (home, April 28), Platinum Stars (away, May 7), Chippa United (home, May 14), Baroka (away, May 17) and Mamelodi Sundowns (home, May 27).
