Lions coach Johan Ackermann will breathe a sigh of relief after flank Jaco Kriel was cleared of any wrongdoing following a hearing relating to foul play during last week s match against the Stormers.The Bok flank is now free to play against the Jaguares on Friday in a crucial Africa 2 conference match at Ellis Park. Last Saturday Kriel was yellow carded by referee Jaco Peyper for a reckless challenge on Stormers flyhalf Rob du Preez during the intense Super Rugby clash at Newlands. After the match Kriel was cited because the commissioner deemed the incident to have met the red card threshold. But upon review a judicial committee comprised of chairman Andre Oosthuizen and former Test players David Croft and Eroni Clarke Kriel was found not guilty of contravening Law 10.4(o) - late charging the kicker. No further sanction has been imposed on the player. The SANZAAR Judicial Hearing was held via videoconference on Wednesday. "Having conducted a detailed review of all the available evidence including all camera angles and additional evidence including from the player and submissions from his legal representative Frikkie Erasmus the Judicial Committee concluded that the red card threshold had not been met to satisfy the citing and that the on field yellow card was sufficient " Oosthuizen said in a statement. "The Judicial Committee found that the player came into contact with the opposing flyhalf in the course of the player attempting to charge down that his action did not amount to an intentional late charge or obstruction and accordingly had not committed a transgression of Law 10.4(o)." "The player is therefore free to resume playing. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
