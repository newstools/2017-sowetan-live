South Africans took their anti-Zuma marches seriously on Friday but typically not without a touch of humour.Social media users took the opportunity to poke fun at the political climate.Many of the memes suggested President Jacob Zuma could not care less what was happening on the streets he would hold on to power regardless. One observer noted the potentially awkward situation the marches could cause evoking the well-known proverb The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Amid Zuma s resilience during increasing calls for him to step down some Tweeters have compared him to Zimbabwe s ruler Robert Mugabe who has governed the country for over three decades despite turmoil at home. More than a few tweets referenced a controversial ad Pepsi recently pulled from the airwaves. In the ad Kendall Jenner leaves a photo shoot before joining a Black Lives Matter protest where she hands a can of Pepsi to a police officer in a gesture of goodwill. Criticism swiftly came from around the globe with many pundits saying the ad trivialised the BLM movement. However many on Twitter were quick to note the serious nature of the day reiterating the importance of Friday s marches and their desire for change at the top of the ANC.
