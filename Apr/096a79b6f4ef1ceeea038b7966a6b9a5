A North West English teacher has been suspended following serious allegations of sexual harassment levelled against him by six pupils.The teacher, from a school in Mmabatho, Mahikeng, cannot be named as he is yet to be charged.He allegedly fondled the Grade 8 schoolgirls in his office and unzipped their skirts. The alleged incident took place on February 7 and was reported by the pupils to the school's principal the same day.North West education department spokesman Freddy Sepeng said the teacher has been suspended, pending an investigation."We are aware of the matter and it is being investigated at the district," Sepeng said.The distraught mother of a 14-year-old victim recalled her horror when her daughter revealed the ordeal and said she was not comfortable going to school anymore.Another mother of a 12-year-old girl did not want to comment but confirmed her daughter was also a victim.A third mother of a 13-year-old said: "My daughter told me that the teacher unzipped her skirt and fixed her friend's bra in the office when they went to fetch files."The mother said her daughter reported the matter to the principal, who allegedly claimed the girls were "lying" ."My daughter had to go to another teacher who asked them to write a letter detailing what had happened."I cannot believe that our children had to go through such horrible experiences yet the principal does not believe them," said the parent.Recounting their ordeal in the letter, the girls told how the teacher had "touched their bums and breasts" when they went to his office."We asked him where our files were and he stood up. He unzipped my friend's skirt, tried to fix my bra," said one girl in the letter seen by Sowetan.When the girls' parents asked the school principal if any action would be taken against the teacher, she allegedly said she could not afford to lose him.The parents alleged that the principal then later said she would investigate the matter."She also told us that she will report the matter to the department [of education] but when I called the department a week later, they had no knowledge of the matter," the mother of the 13-year-old said."My child missed tests as she was called into meetings with the school governing body and the principal without my knowledge. How can they take my child for questioning without my permission? She is a minor," said the mother.When contacted for comment the principal said she needed to consult the school governing body first.
