Many people believe rubber tyres can prevent lighting strikes, and some even place them on the roofs of their homes, but Magdeline Ngoatje's experience can prove that is only a myth.Ngoatje, 33, of Limpopo, had a nasty surprise when her car dealer, Mazda, told her to fork out close R37000 to have her car released from the dealership after it was taken in for repairs.She said her nightmare began after a thunderous and heavy rain was accompanied by lightning in February. She said after the storm she noticed her car lights were on and there was a funny sound coming from inside. Upon checking, she discovered it would not start. She called AA who render towing services to Mazda clients. The tow truck driver decided to jump start the car when they could not start it in a normal way.But when she got the car to the dealership, she was told that it should not have been jump started and that she was liable to pay R15000 to fix its computer box."It was their preferred towing company which damaged the computer box. They should have known that they should not have jump started it," Ngoatje said.She later paid the amount because she needed her car.Ngoatje said although Mazda knew the car could be damaged when jump started, their technician did the same and caused more damage.She said the AA offered to share the costs with its sub-contractor and refund the amount she paid, but they later reneged on this undertaking.When she went to collect the vehicle on Friday, Mazda demanded she pay about R37000 which included replacement of a starter and a battery plus labour without getting her approval.She said she was disappointed with Mazda's service."More suspicious was the fact that they kept demanding payment for parts that a new car should not require," said a disgruntled Ngoatje.She said she no longer trusts their car and does not know what will happen to her the next time it rains.Jerry Phaleng, of TJP Towing, said the car suffered damage as a result of lightning and his company was called to tow it.Philip Purnel, of AA, who subcontracted TJP Towing, denied liability and also cited lightning as the cause of the damage.Hugo Richards, a general manager at Mazda, said damage of an electrical nature was caused by lightning.He said this was very similar to a vehicle being incorrectly jump started, but was usually more extensive. Hugo said such damage was not covered by the manufacturer's warranty, that it is an insurance matter. He added that the extent of the electrical damage can only be determined through a process of elimination.He said they kept Ngoatje informed all the way and they provided work based on her approval.
