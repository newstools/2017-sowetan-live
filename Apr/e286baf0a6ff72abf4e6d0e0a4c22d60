Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has fired one of her special advisors Sipho Shezi.Shezi confirmed to BDlive that he was informed in a letter delivered on Friday stating that his services were no longer needed.When asked what reasons were given for dismissing him Shezi said there were none and he was fine with that. I would not really insist on her giving reasons In terms of the contract at any given time the parties can decide to terminate the contract without notice he said. So I have respected that process. Shezi was named in the department s former director-general Zane Dangor s affidavit to the Constitutional Court regarding the social grant debacle. He appeared to be one of the senior officials who with Dangor and others were trying to find solutions to ensure that the Social Security Agency of South Africa (Sassa) could take over the payment of grants.Dangor has claimed that the Sassa crisis was self-created to facilitate a continuous relationship with Cash Paymaster Services.
