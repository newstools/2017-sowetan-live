A defiant Steve Komphela said Kaizer Chiefs would continue fighting to the last game in their bid to avoid a second successive season without silverware even after their title aspirations were handed a blow on Tuesday night when they lost away at leaders Cape Town City. We never give up " said the Chiefs coach."For as long as mathematically it makes sense we will keep pushing."Even if there is no hope in our last match we have a responsibility to the Chiefs supporters to keep pushing and play good football so that when we leave Chiefs when the time comes that this generation is no more people will look and say they might not have won anything but goodness me what a game they were playing . AmaKhosi s dramatic 3-2 defeat in a match where they had a myriad of chances to wrap up the result has left them four points behind the leaders and seen them slip down to fourth in the standings.Komphela faces a second season in charge without any silverware after Judas Moseamedi scored deep in stoppage time to win it for the home club who remain top of the table. It s sad we lost we had chances we threw everything at them. I m proud of my players he added.Komphela had to leave the bench during the second half for a short period to change his torn pants he explained after the game. Things happened in football the only thing is that I m lucky that I usually bring two pants to the game."The other one just got buggered. It got torn."I had to go to the dressing room and go and change my pants."When I got back the bench told me we had missed two clear chances."But if I m going down I m going down with pride. Chiefs have little chance for respite as their next game is away at SuperSport United on Saturday with a chance to avenge last weekend s Nedbank Cup elimination.After that they will have four games left in the league season -- Lamontville Golden Arrows (May 6 home) Polokwane City (May 13 away) Platinum Stars (May 17 away) and Bidvest Wits at home on May 27. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
