He then starts shoving and pushing the driver of a orange Ford Ranger. Several people rush over to try and break the men up before the Ford driver goes back to his vehicle and fetches his firearm. In a subsequent squabble which followed after the Ford driver hit the truck driver in the head a single gunshot can clearly be heard.SAPS spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a case was being investigated.Andreas Mathios media liaison for Blue Security who was on the scene shortly after the shooting said it appeared the driver of the truck realised he wouldn t fit under the arched bridge so moved into the fast lane where the arch was at its highest. However he cut off the Ford which was in the fast lane. The two vehicles came to a halt blocking the road completely before the skirmish.
