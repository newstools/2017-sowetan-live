Chippa United skipper Thamsanqa Sangweni says they will not take lower tier side Jomo Cosmos for granted when the two sides meet in a tasty Nedbank Cup quarterfinal at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday afternoon.Coach Dan Malesela's charges are making a maiden appearance in this stage of the competition and Sangweni is hopeful that they will keep alive beyond Saturday.But National First Division side Cosmos could present a formidable obstacle to those ambitions and the multiple injuries the Chilli Boys picked up after their energy-sapping 1-0 league defeat to Kaizer Chiefs at the weekend will also give Malesela plenty to thick about.Sangweni said while they have had their ups and downs in recent weeks he believes they still have enough muscle in their ranks to withstand whatever Ezenkosi throw at them. Everyone is ready even though we have been struggling in a few games but I think we are ready for this one " he said. Even in the league we are trying so hard to get points. Everything is important. Cup games are important as well as league matches. But I am happy that we are still in the running for the Nedbank Cup. Hopefully on Saturday we will win and go to the next round. We won t take them for granted because we have experienced such things before. I think we will take it a game at a time and also respect Jomo Cosmos players. But the most important thing is for us to focus on our game in order to win. The Port Elizabeth-based soccer team beat NFD side Witbank Spurs 1-0 in the last 32 of the tournament to reach the Last 16 stage.They then progressed to the quarterfinals after thrashing Polokwane City 2-0.Kick off is at 3pm in the Windy City on Saturday. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
