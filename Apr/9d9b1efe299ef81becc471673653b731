The wisdom of the Sharks deciding to field a second-string team in their away clash against the Jaguares on Saturday will be put to the test given that the Durban side maintains a slim four points lead over their opponents.The fact is South African teams have underestimated the Jaguares at home and they've all been punished for this oversight.The Lions were put away 36-24 and the Cheetahs were unceremoniously dismantled 41-14.The Sharks are better than the Cheetahs but the Jaguares in Buenos Aires are a different story.The Jaguares last lost to South African opposition at home on May 14 last year when the Sharks narrowly outlasted them 25-22.The Stormers were also fortunate to escape 13-8 in March last year but that was last year's rabble outfit.Discipline may still be a problem for Raul Perez's side but they have more structure and ability to tear apart defences.Sharks coach Robert du Preez made eight changes to the side that huffed and puffed to a turgid 9-all draw against the Rebels in Durban on Saturday.The two significant changes are that of Jeremy Ward starting at inside centre as the harebrained Andre Esterhuizen starts his six-week suspension.Odwa Ndungane will make his 137th Super Rugby appearance with his start at right wing.Another milestone is that of Warren Whiteley making his 75th appearance for the Lions when they face the Force on Saturday in Perth.Lions coach Johan Ackermann made five changes from the side that narrowly got past the Jaguares 24-21 with Kwagga Smith starting at openside flank.Madosh Tambwe who is with the Under-20's has been replaced by Sylvian Mahuza.The menacing Crusaders have made only one change to the side that demolished the Stormers 57-24 in Christchurch.Bryn Hall will start ahead of Mitchell Drummond as Crusaders coach Scott Robertson looks to maintain his team's unbeaten record.The Kings will be hosting the Rebels in Port Elizabeth in the 7.30 match slotSuper Rugby fixtures:Friday: Highlanders v Stormers (Dunedin 9.35am) Saturday: Chiefs v Sunwolves (Hamilton 9.35am) Reds v Waratahs (Brisbane 11.40am) Force v Lions (Perth 13.55 ) Cheetahs v Crusaders (Bloemfontein 17.15) Kings v Rebels (Port Elizabeth 19.30) Jaguares v Sharks (Buenos Aires 21.40)Teams that have been announced:HIGHLANDERS: 15 Ben Smith (captain) 14 Waisake Naholo 13 Malakai Fekitoa 12 Rob Thompson 11 Patrick Osborne 10 Marty Banks 9 Aaron Smith 8 Liam Squire 7 Dillon Hunt 6 Gareth Evans 5 Tom Franklin 4 Alex Ainley 3 Siosuia Halanukonuka 2 Liam Coltman 1 Daniel Lienert-Brown.Replacements: 16 Greg Pleasants-Tate 17 Aki Seiuli 18 Siate Tokolahi 19 Joe Wheeler 20 Jackson Hemopo 21 Kayne Hammington 22 Fletcher Smith 23 Matt Faddes.STORMERS: 15 Sarel Marais 14 Cheslin Kolbe 13 EW Viljoen 12 Dan Kriel 11 Dillyn Leyds 10 Robert du Preez 9 Jano Vermaak 8 Nizaam Carr 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit 6 Siya Kolisi (captain) 5 Jan de Klerk 4 Eben Etzebeth (vice-captain) 3 Frans Malherbe 2 Bongi Mbonambi 1 Oliver Kebble.Replacements: 16 Ramone Samuels 17 JC Janse van Rensburg 18 Wilco Louw 19 Kobus van Dyk 20 Sikhumbuzo Notshe 21 Dewaldt Duvenage 22 Shaun Treeby (Stormers debut) 23 Bjorn Basson.LIONS: 15 Andries Coetzee 14 Sylvian Mahuza 13 Lionel Mapoe 12 Harold Vorster 11 Courtnall Skosan 10 Elton Jantjies 9 Francois de Klerk 8 Warren Whiteley 7 Ruan Ackermann 6 Albertus Smith 5 Franco Mostert 4 Andries Ferreira 3 Ruan Dreyer 2 Malcolm Marx 1 Jacques van Rooyen.Replacements: 16 Robbie Coetzee 17 Corne Fourie 18 Johannes Jonker 19 Lourens Erasmus 20 Cyle Brink 21 Dillon Smit 22 Jacques Nel 23 Anthony Volmink.CRUSADERS: 15 David Havili 14 Seta Tamanivalu 13 Jack Goodhue 12 Ryan Crotty 11 George Bridge 10 Richie Mo'unga 9 Bryn Hall 8 Kieran Read 7 Matt Todd 6 Jordan Taufua 5 Sam Whitelock (captain) 4 Scott Barrett 3 Owen Franks 2 Codie Taylor 1 Joe Moody.Replacements: 16 Andrew Makalio 17 Wyatt Crockett 18 Michael Alaalatoa 19 Luke Romano 20 Pete Samu 21 Mitchell Drummond 22 Mitchell Hunt 23 Manasa Mataele.SHARKS: 15 Rhyno Smith 14 Odwa Ndungane 13 Lukhanyo Am 12 Jeremy Ward 11 Lwazi Mvovo 10 Curwin Bosch 9 Michael Claassens 8 Daniel du Preez 7 Jean-Luc du Preez 6 Philip van der Walt (captain) 5 Stephan Lewies 4 Ruan Botha 3 Lourens Adriaanse 2 Mahlatse Ralepelle 1 Thomas du Toit.Replacements: 16 Franco Marais 17 Juan Schoeman 18 Coenie Oosthuizen 19 Etienne Oosthuizen 20 Lubabalo Mtembu 21 Cobus Reinach 22 Benhard Janse van Rensburg 23 Johan Deysel. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
