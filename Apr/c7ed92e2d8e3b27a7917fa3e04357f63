A clear the air meeting between Ajax Cape Town players and their coach Stanley Menzo will hopefully be the catalyst for their first victory of the year said the beleaguered trainer as the side prepared to face fellow strugglers Highlands Park on Wednesday.Players concern over the relationship with Menzo and poor results since the turn of the year precipitated the gathering followed a team-building braai the next evening as Ajax look for solutions to end their eight match winless streak. We had a good week and after the standard of our training yesterday (Monday) and today (Tuesday) I can go to sleep close my eyes " Menzo told a media conference in Cape Town on Tuesday."I will wake up tomorrow morning (Wednesday) and say go boys because I have a very good feeling about our chances."Of course that s no guarantee that you win. But the mood is good."Of course when you don t win and there is pressure and let s say it starts from outside and then shakes up inside then comes those meetings."That s something normal in football that when it doesn t go well then we have to talk and to find where the solution can be."That is what the meeting was about and I don t think that is abnormal. For me and I said this last week already I m looking for the key to get the engine started again because it was running properly but then the engine stooped."I haven t been able to find the key up to now. Former Dutch international goalkeeper Menzo took over from Roger de Sa in November and hoisted Ajax off the foot of the Premier Soccer League standings with five wins in six matches including a 2-0 triumph over champions Mamelodi Sundowns.But since Christmas Ajax have not won again and are now precariously placed just two points above the relegation zone. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
