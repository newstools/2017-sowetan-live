Pitso Mosimane has lashed out at Bafana Bafana stand-in coach Owen Da Gama over defender Tebogo Langerman.Mosimane was seething that Da Gama played the left-back for a full 90 minutes in the recent friendlies against Guinea Bissau in Durban and Angola in East London.As a result, the player started on the bench against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. "You've got to understand he wants to be the coach of Bafana, so he drilled them," said Mosimane. "It's not the first time..Owen decided to choose one left-back in the whole country?" asked Mosimane, who started the game with Algerian Fares Haichi ahead of Langerman.Haichi struggled against Chiefs and was replaced by Langerman during the second half. - Tiyani wa ka Mabasa
