As if things couldn't get any worse for the Bulls flyhalf Handr Pollard suffered a freak accident at training on Thursday and will be out of rugby for 8-10 weeks.Pollard suffered an ankle (syndesmosis) injury at training and will require surgery. The Bulls will issue an update when they have a clearer picture of the injury but it s a blow to the team after just two wins in seven matches. The 23-year-old Springbok has had a slow start to the 2017 Super Rugby campaign following nearly a year on the sidelines after sustaining torn knee ligaments in early 2016. But last week against the Jaguares the talented Junior World Championship winner showed encouraging signs that he was on an upward curve.He scored 16 points and delivered a strong performance. This injury is a major set back for the Bulls the player and the Springboks. Pollard would have been a certainty in the Bok squad for the June series against France having already proved his worth at Test level. But his misfortune now sees the door open for Sharks sensation Curwin Bosch who must be in pole position for the flyhalf berth if he maintains his stellar form. Bosch is still eligible for the SA under-20 side that will play in the Junior World Championships in June. But he might find himself competing for higher honours in six weeks time. For Bosch s long-term career it might be prudent to play at the Junior World Championships but the 19-year-old s sheer talent is hard to ignore. If Bok coach Allister Coetzee overlooks Bosch then he would have to turn to Elton Jantjies who has failed to impress at Test level or the rusty Pat Lambie. The experienced Lambie should be back on the field in two weeks after suffering a fractured vertebra in early March while the Stormers Rob du Preez has also enhanced his Test claims in recent weeks. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
