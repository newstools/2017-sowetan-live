Five donkeys have been adopted after they were rescued earlier this year in the Sani area in KwaZulu-Natal an animal rescue organisation said on Tuesday.The adoptions form part of an effort to combat the trade in donkey skins said the National Council of SPCAs (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals). We report that 5 donkeys have arrived at a beautiful property in Bethlehem in the Free State where they will live out the rest of their lives the National Council of SPCAs said. A further 14 donkeys will travel shortly to a new home. Their adoptions have been approved as all the required administration and procedures have been undertaken. The donkeys were rescued in the Sani area in early 2017. They were initially cared for at the Sani SPCA but it was feared that the donkeys might be stolen given the proximity to the Lesotho border post.It was decided to move the animals to other SPCAs. The journey to their temporary homes started early on the morning of 24 February 2017 when they were safely loaded into trucks and their journey to the Benoni SPCA and the Kloof and Highway SPCA began the organisation said. No issues were encountered. Several stops were made en route to Johannesburg to provide water and facilitate checks by our Inspectors and veterinarian.
