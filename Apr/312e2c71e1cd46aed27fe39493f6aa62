Luc Eymael has decided to appeal of a dispute resolution chamber (DRC) decision ordering him back to old club Polokwane City from Bloemfontein Celtic.Celtic chief executive Khumbulani Konco confirmed this on Tuesday saying that the club are not part of the proceedings of that appeal against the outcome by the Premier Soccer League s DRC. It s not a joint-appeal. It s a separate one. It s the coach appealing on his own Konco explained. We were not involved in the case technically because we didn t attend the hearing. The only time that we were involved was at the beginning when they (the DRC) refused his registration. We were not part of the second part (the dispute over Eymael s reasons for leaving City). Eymael was instructed to return to City by the DRC on April 18.The coach has been the figure of a dispute by City after quitting the Limpopo club on March 9 then joining Celtic the following day.Polokwane initially demanded R2 8 million in compensation for Eymael s services on the basis of a breach of contract disputing the coach s stated reason for leaving City as unhappiness at his working conditions.Eymael has maintained that he never left City with the intention of joining Celtic.He has told the media that he fears for his personal safety and even his life should he be made to return to City where his working relationship with chairman Johnny Mogaladi has clearly broken down.Konco meanwhile also confirmed that current Celtic caretaker-coaches Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka will continue in that role until the case is resolved . - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
