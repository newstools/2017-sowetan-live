Akani Simbine's exploits have made him international race organisers' sought-after commodity.There's a serious scramble to include the 23-year-old SA 100m champion in international meetings, said his agent Peet van Zyl.The Rio Olympics finalist has already been confirmed to line-up in Usain Bolt's farewell race in the short dash in Jamaica in June."We've got nice new options open up for Akani after he ran 9.95 [seconds in the 100m final last Friday]. He starts in Doha [IAAF Diamond League next Friday] in the 100m and he will then run the 100 in Boston, US, on June 4 where Wayde will also open [his international campaign] with the 200m."Then we're off to Jamaica where Akani will run 100m - and Wayde the 200m - in Bolt's farewell race on June 10," said Van Zyl, who also looks after the business interests of Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk."Akani has already been invited to run in Budapest [Hungary] where he ran the SA record 9.89 in July last year. There are also invitations to the Diamond Leagues in Paris (July 1), Lausanne (July 6), London (July 9), Monaco (July 21). But we're really looking to be clever in a way that we structure Akani's season not to over-race him. We'll select carefully."Van Zyl is in Europe to secure deals for some of his clients that include long jumper Ruswahl Samaai and sprinter Henricho Bruintjies.
