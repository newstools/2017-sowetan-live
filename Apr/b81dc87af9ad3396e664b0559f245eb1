Wednesday night s match against Kaizer Chiefs will mark the 25th time that Bloemfontein Celtic play at the Dr Molemela Stadium in Rocklands since the imposing venue completed a massive upgrade and was renamed after the club s long-standing owner Petrus Molemela.But the former Slaughterhouse has not proven a happy hunting ground for Celtic.Phunya Sele Sele returned to the venue 18 months ago but have posted a disappointing run of home results even if the crowds often provide a rousing atmosphere that is among the best in the country.They lost their first match on the day of the re-opening and renaming of the venue which used to be called the Seisa Ramabodou Stadium to Mamelodi Sundowns on October 21 2015.Since then they have won just five times including Sunday s narrow 2-1 triumph in the second round of the Nedbank Cup over Mbombela United of the National First Division.It took three months to win their first home game which came against Bidvest Wits and four more months before they won again demolishing Ajax Cape Town 5-0.In the league this season Celtic have won only twice at home -- beating Baroka and Chippa United at home in the league.In total the Molemela Stadium has seen Celtic draw seven times and lose 12 times half of all their 24 games since the re-opening.Celtic have only used the Molemela Stadium for their home matches since the R300-milliion upgrade of the venue. In the past they also used the Free State Stadium in the city centre as well as Botshabelo. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
