SuperSport United are set to play their last match under head coach Stuart Baxter when they meet Liberian outfit Barrack Young Controllers in the CAF Confederation Cup play-off round tomorrow (6pm).The two sides will clash at Antoinette Tubman Stadium in Monrovia, with the winner over two legs progressing to the group stage.Baxter will likely take over as Bafana Bafana coach in the coming week.He said he will rotate his squad against Barrack to ensure they will be ready for the Tshwane derby on their return.They face Mamelodi Sundowns on Thursday at Loftus Stadium in a league clash."We've got to rotate the team again. You can't have players coming off one game against Baroka, playing in the Nedbank Cup [against Kwa-Dukuza United], travelling 16 hours to Liberia and coming back to play against Sundowns," he said. "We will give it a shot in Liberia and come back with a useful result."It's so difficult to get good intelligence on them [Barrack], but by the time we get to kickoff I would have got information."Barrack compete in the Liberian top flight, which is divided into two groups. They are top of their group after nine matches.Meanwhile, Bidvest Wits, who are second on the Absa Premiership standings, are also likely to rotate players.The Clever Boys are also competing in the Confederation Cup and will host Egyptian side Smouha at Bidvest Stadium tomorrow (3pm).Platinum Stars are also vying for a place in the group stages. Dikwena are playing Ivorian side AS Tanda Stade Robert Champroux in Abidjan on Sunday (5.30pm).
