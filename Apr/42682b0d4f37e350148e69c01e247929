There won't be a moment of silence to remember the Ellis Park tragedy when Orlando Pirates host Martizburg United in their Absa Premiership clash at Orlando Stadium tonight (7.30pm)."We have not made any plans as the PSL [to commemorate the day]", league spokesman Luxolo September said yesterday. Today marks 16 years since 43 people died in a stampede in the game between Kaizer Chiefs and Pirates.Annette Nation - who lost her son Rosswin during the stampede - said she had received no response from both the PSL and SA Football Association despite sending emails to invite at least one representative to today's event at the Doornfontein venue.Like she did last year, Nation has taken it upon herself to remember those who lost their lives in 2001.She said a memorial service will be held at Ellis Park between 10am and 11am this morning."We've had no response, but we are going on and we hope to have as many families as possible," said Nation.Meanwhile, Pirates have to put their hopes of winning the Nedbank Cup aside to focus on Maritzburg tonight. "It will be tough because we have just two days to rest."It's also fun to play at home again. We have not played at home in over a month," said Bucs coach Kjell Jonevret after the game against Stars at the weekend.
