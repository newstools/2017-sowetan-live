What started as a peaceful protest on Friday outside the Gupta family compound in Saxonwold Johannesburg by Black Friday demonstrators degenerated into fisticuffs when Black First Land First members arrived.Initially the Black Friday and Black First Land First protesters sang at each other with the latter planning to disrupt the demonstration.But the anti-Zuma protesters refused to be cowed and the situation became tense.Police separated the warring groups late on Friday afternoon using police tape and later asked the protesters to go home.Those who had been gathering in groups from noon carrying placards calling for President Jacob Zuma to go refused to leave.Black First Land First protesters said they would defend the Gupta family despite the presence of no less than five police vehicles which had been monitoring the otherwise peaceful demonstration.They also accused former finance minister Pravin Gordhan of protecting white people and white banks. eNCA on TwitterBREAKING NEWS: Stun grenades used during the protest at the #GuptaCompound https://t.co/bQWey6btNa
