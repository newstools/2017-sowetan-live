Paramedics tried in vain to save the life of a 15-year-old boy who was found trapped in the driver s seat of a car which had smashed into a tree in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday. The teenager was in a critical condition after the vehicle rolled off Besters Road outside of Watersmeet. Paramedics found a 15-year-old boy lying trapped in the driver s seat while a 19-year-old boy was found in the passenger s seat. The younger patient was found to be in a critical condition while the eldest was found to have sustained moderate injuries said ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring.Rescuers used the jaws-of-life to cut the teenager from the wreckage but his condition deteriorated. CPR and advanced life support were immediately initiated in an effort to revive the patient. Unfortunately after some time no vital signs returned and the boy was declared dead on the scene said Meiring. The 19-year-old was carefully extricated from the vehicle and treated for his injuries. Once treated he was transported to a provincial hospital for further care. The cause of the collision is under investigation. TMG Digital
