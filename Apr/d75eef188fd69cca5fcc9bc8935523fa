It is not me saying it or interpreting it but it is the new finance minister, Malusi Gigaba, who has said it. In assuring the international and domestic markets, Gigaba said there will be no substantial policy changes in the Treasury.If it is so, what we are then left with is change in personnel (from one minister to the next) to drive or implement standing policies.What we are also left with is change in the leadership styles and organisational, political and interpersonal relationships. We are not going to have, as evidence demonstrates, fundamental transformation in philosophy, structure, depth in and strategy of the Treasury.To this end, we have cosmetic or superficial changes, not deeper structural transformation.I am therefore at a loss as to how declared policy continuity and personnel change, in this specific context, can even remotely be qualified as some form of (new) radical economic transformation, with possibilities of widespread empowerment of the historically economically marginalised - mainly black people and particularly black women.This is largely a replacement of one elite personnel structure by another. It is not a configuration, despite the propaganda in support of it, that is aimed at large-scale empowerment of the marginalised and the middle classes.What would be a mistake, though, in my view, is a hasty and baseless interpretation that seems to suggest that the reshuffle would alter for better the lives of nine million unemployed South Africans, let alone in the space of 24 months or so that President Jacob Zuma has left at the helm of the Republic.The people whose lives are also not going to change, yet are affected the most, and who have been very vocal on social media, are the middle class.These are people with unpaid houses, cars, credit cards. These are people who live largely on debt. Yet these people, who all stand to suffer mostly economically, are ambiguous about what to do politically.The people in this category will all lose, just at different rates.What the changes then mean, as it happened in the past 22 years of SA's democracy, is the growth and (re)emergence of an additional thin layer of rich and super rich elite, built on intricate political economic networks and relatively new set of power relations.Yet the layer of political economic elites which grew under Nelson Mandela did not replace the elite who grew under FW de Klerk, and the ones who grew under Thabo Mbeki did not replace the ones who grew under Madiba, the new elite will not replace the current ones.The new governing elite too will have to produce elites of their own to appraise themselves as having done something new.
