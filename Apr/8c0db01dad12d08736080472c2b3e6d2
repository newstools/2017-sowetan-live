Defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns while focusing on beating Ajax Cape Town will have an eye on the clash between Cape Town City and Kaizer Chiefs in a big night of fixtures in the Absa Premiership on Tuesday.The PSL s other big title chasers Bidvest Wits add to the mix as they take on fifth-placed SuperSport United at Bidvest Stadium.Sundowns (fourth place on 44 points from 22 games) and Wits (in second on 45 from 22) have two games in hand on leaders City (46 points from 24) and third-placed Chiefs (45 from 24).Wits and Sundowns would not mind City and Chiefs playing to a draw at Cape Town Stadium. A win for both the Clever Boys and Brazilians would then see them catapult into first and second place and still with two extra games to be played.They perhaps also might not be displeased should Chiefs stop City a team with on a roll without a defeat from nine games in 2017 with six of those victories in their tracks with a victory to Amakhosi.City have a sniff at a fairytale league victory in their first season of reincarnation from a team that once campaigned in the 1960s and 1970s in the old all-white National Football League.A group of players most of whom have never challenged for a league title and might not again have their tails up by having kept themselves in striking distance as the finish line nears. Leicester City s English Premier League title win last season displayed how dangerous that situation can be.Chiefs are unbeaten in 12 matches in the PSL but their penalties Nedbank Cup defeat against SuperSport at home ground FNB Stadium on Saturday exposed cracks in the at times unconvincing brand of football played by the Soweto giants this season.Amakhosi might be regarded as the lesser threat of the top four teams.A win to City will leave the PSL increasingly poised towards a three-way sprint to the finish.Wits too can hammer what would surely be the final nail into the coffin of the title chances of SuperSport (37 points from 23 games) at Bidvest.Sundowns will be odds-on favourites to beat Ajax at Loftus Versfeld The Brazilians have won their last six home games against the Urban Warriors and continue a recovery from a slump of five winless games with a fourth successive victory.Tuesday (all 7.30pm): Mamelodi Sundowns v Ajax Cape Town (Loftus Versfeld Stadium) Bloemfontein Celtic v Highlands Park (Dr. Molemela Stadium) Bidvest Wits v SuperSport United (Bidvest Stadium) Cape Town City v Kaizer Chiefs (Cape Town Stadium) Polokwane City v Lamontville Golden Arrows (Old Peter Mokaba Stadium) Chippa United v Maritzburg United (Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium) How they stand: 1.
