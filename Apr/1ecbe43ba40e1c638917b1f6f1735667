With options on the bench and character on the pitch, Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala believes they are on the right track to achieving their goals this season.Amakhosi were given a scare when ABC Motsepe League outfit Acornbush United took the lead in their Nedbank Cup last 16 clash at Kabokweni Stadium on Sunday but showed their experience by coming back to win 2-1, thanks to a brace from substitute Gustavo Paez.It's that sort of character, Tshabalala believes, that third-placed Amakhosi need in the league to reclaim the Absa Premiership title Mamelodi Sundowns snatched from them last season.Next on their league schedule is Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm)."It was a close one [against Acornbush]. We knew that it was not going to be easy. Two goals in the dying stages is character. It's experience. We came here, did the business and we move on," said Tshabalala, whose freekick in the 3-1 win over Free State Stars was voted Premiership goal of the Month for February."[Celtic will be] another tough hurdle. If we maintain our work ethic and show character, then we'll get there one game at a time. It's an away game. They are not in a good position, but we are focusing on our journey."Tshabalala was delighted to see Paez coming off the bench and making a difference."Paez came in and did the job, which is good for the team. There's options on the bench. [William] Twala did very well. Rama [Mphahlele] was not playing, so [Kgotso] Moleko came in and did well," said Tshabalala.
