The arbitration case between the South African Football Association (Safa) and former Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim Shakes Mashaba at the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) offices in Johannesburg has been adjourned to May 22.Expected on the stand when the hearing resumes next month for possibly its last stretch would be Safa chief executive Dennis Mumble and Mashaba himself.Mumble could not give evidence this week because of a trip to New York where he is meeting with high ranking US Soccer Federation officials.Mashaba who has taken Safa to the CCMA after he was dismissed in December will take the stand after his erstwhile employers have presented their case.Last week Safa and Mashaba's representatives met with CCMA commissioner Hlalele Molotsi in a bid to find an amicable solution to the long-running saga.But they could not find each other and the matter continues.Safa offered Mashaba an out of court settlement of R2million but the former coach wanted the money after tax and the organization could not meet that demand.Mashaba s lawyer Claudio Bollo and Mark Thompson of Safa have repeatedly insisted that the possibility of a settlement remains possible and there is hope that the two parties will eventually find each other. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
