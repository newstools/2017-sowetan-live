As Orlando Pirates remain rooted in 11th place in the Absa Premiership having not won in 12 league matches the unthinkable question looms on how seriously the Buccaneers take the prospect of fighting relegation seriously.New coach Kjell Jonevret - who has so far only managed to try to wrestle Pirates back to form but not succeeded yet following three league draws and Saturday's 3-2 defeat against Free State Stars in Orkney - was asked that question on Tuesday.His reply was that as long as Pirates remain in 11th just five points (23) above last-placed Baroka FC (18) Bucs take the prospect of fighting relegation very seriously."You always have to take things like that seriously " Jonevret said."There are a lot of clubs who don't think they can and they don't believe it until they are there."So you have to take care and you have to think seriously about such things all the time."But for me right now it's the cup game [against Free State Stars this Saturday] first."Jonevret conceded that the Bucs are in a serious situation."Of course it's a serious situation " he said."And maybe Pirates are not used to it because normally they are much higher."But we have talked about this."And the only way to turn this around to something positive is what we are doing out their [on the training pitch]."Work hard and every day will lead us away from it."Of course we see we read."But hopefully we are going to win a few games and then we don't have to talk about that any more."But as long as we are down there we have to take it seriously. Absolutely."Pirates turn their attention to the Nedbank Cup on Saturday night where they face a replay against Stars at the same venue at Orkney's James Motlatsi Stadium. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
