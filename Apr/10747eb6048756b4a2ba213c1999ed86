Kentucky Fried Chicken has announced plans to serve antibiotic-free chicken at all their US restaurants by the end of next year. As part of their larger turnaround strategy, which includes bringing back the Colonel, simplifying operations and remodeling their restaurants, the fast food chain has announced that by the end of 2018, all chicken purchased by the company will be raised without antibiotics important to human health including their chicken-on-the-bone menu items, a first for a national quick service chain in the US, the company claims.According to the World Health Organization, the use of antimicrobials in animals destined for our plates can create an antimicrobial resistant bacteria that can spread to humans through the food supply. The group has called on the industry to reduce its use in food animals. "Making this change was complex and took a lot of planning," said Kevin Hochman, president in a statement. "It required close collaboration with more than 2,000 farms, most of them family-owned and managed, in more than a dozen US states where they raise our chickens." The fast food chain is the latest company to make such pledges to the public. Earlier this year, Tyson Foods outlined their "no antibiotics ever" pledge for their poultry products. Other fast food chains like Chick-fil-A, Burger King, McDonald's have made similar pledges. KFC had also pledged previously to end the use of artificial colors and flavors by 2018, and the use of food dyes by the end of the year.
