Bidvest Wits young defender Reeve Frosler relishes the opportunity to play alongside his role model Daine Klate at the Clever Boys.Frosler, 19, made his Wits senior debut against Chippa United last month. Since then, the Port Elizabeth-born defender has not looked back."When there was a game on TV, I was happy to watch Klate because he is also from Port Elizabeth. It was inspiring,'' said Frosler."I have always wanted to be like him. It is a dream come true. I trust that it will take me to bigger things."The junior international defender's scintillating displays against Egyptian outfit Smouha in the CAF Confederation Cup tie at the weekend may help him retain his berth in the starting 11 when Wits host Golden Arrows tonight.
