Opposition parties, who have joined forces in a bid to have President Jacob Zuma removed from office, have in principle agreed to throw their support behind a new formation, the Freedom Movement.Protests against Zuma continue to dominate the public discourse and the movement, made up of civil society, labour and faith-based organisations, will now gather in Pretoria on Freedom Day.Members of the Freedom Movement, who briefed journalists in Soweto yesterday, were joined by DA leader Mmusi Maimane and the UDM's Bantu Holomisa.Holomisa said the invitation to join the Freedom Movement was discussed at a meeting of opposition party leaders earlier this week.Those represented at the meeting were the DA, UDM, EFF, Cope, IFP and African Christian Democratic Party.Holomisa, however, said it would be financially challenging for them to bus their members to Pretoria on April 27."Some parties said we will encourage our people to participate but we are exhausted from the march we had last week in terms of resources," Holomisa said.Opposition parties marched to the Union Buildings last week calling on Zuma to resign. Holomisa said he and Maimane would report back to the opposition parties.Maimane said the DA was committed to the process and would invest in making sure the gathering on Freedom Day took place."It's expensive, we have been partners in two marches already . but we hold the view that there comes a time in our country when you need to stand up and do something for your nation," he said.
