Platinum Stars beat Baroka FC 1-0 in their uninspiring Nedbank Cup last 16 clash that was played at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Tuesday night.Stars goal was scored by striker Ndumiso Mabena deep into injury time of extra time to break the hearts of Baroka and dump them out of the tournament they have performed admirably in the past.The two teams went to the break with no goals scored as a result of a forgettable opening half which failed to come to life where few notable moments were produced.In the second, Baroka had a golden opportunity to take the lead just after the hour mark but Mxolisi Kunene riffled his shot over the cross-bar after Punch Masenamela s pass found him unmarked in the box.A few minutes later, another chance went begging for the home side as Mpho Kgaswane also could not find the back of the net from inside the box with Stars goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela to beat.12 minutes into extra time, Siyabonga Zulu s tame shot from close range could not beat Baroka goalkeeper Ayanda Dlamini as another chance went begging much to the frustration of his coach Cavin Johnson and his team-matesStars played the last six minutes of the match after Sphamandla Mlilo was shown red for an unsporting tackle on Rithabile Soso.TMG Digital
