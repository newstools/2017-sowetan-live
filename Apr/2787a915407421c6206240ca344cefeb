Mamelodi Sundowns star forward Khama Billiat has thanked the club s at times notoriously ferociously fickle supporters for standing behind the team through a recent slump.Sundowns appear to have bounced back from a run of five Absa Premiership matches and one cup game without a win with a 5-0 thrashing of SuperSport United on Thursday night a 1-0 away win against Free State Stars on Sunday and another win over Supersport (1-0) on Wednesday night.Downs supporters have been known to eject coaches with their furious protests and at one stage early last season were gunning for current boss Pitso Mosimane with chants of Pitso out .However they showed great patience through Sundowns recent slump cutting the African champions some slack and coming to the stadium in their numbers to vocally support and stand behind their struggling team. We really appreciate it. It shows that we just need to deliver and give people that hope and to do things that make sure they keep people coming Billiat said. Not to lose a game where we show that we are not fighting. Because these people don t get paid to come to the stadium. They really sacrifice and we really appreciate that. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
