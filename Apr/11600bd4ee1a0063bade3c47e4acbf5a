The executive mayor of the City of Tshwane Solly Msimanga and Tshwane metro police department chief Steven Ngobeni have parted ways. Msimanga said that following comprehensive discussions with Ngobeni and the city manager Moeketsi Mosola it had been agreed that Ngobeni would vacate his position.The mayor said this was subsequent to the city failing to reach an amicable solution regarding the relationship between Ngobeni and the municipality. Msimanga added that all three parties had agreed that it was in the best interests of the city and the leadership that Ngobeni step down to prevent any further damage to our law enforcement agency . To avoid the vacuum that may occur in the Metro Police department which will negatively affect the administration and the department it is of utmost importance that an acting chief of police be appointed until such time until the vacancy has been filled to ensure that necessary administration of the municipality and the Metro Police department continues and that the people of Tshwane and the City s property are properly protected and that law and order is maintained in our City added Msimanga.Deputy Chief of Police Jenny Malan has since been appointed to act in the position on a month-to-month basis.Msimanga had previously accused Ngobeni of allegedly failing to act and eject unruly ANC councillors who overturned tables and chairs during his State of the City address.The disruptions prevented Msimanga from delivering his state of the capital address for about five hours. When ANC councillors refused to leave speaker Katlego Mathebe adjourned the sitting. Msimanga was forced to address the guests from another room.
