Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela knows a number of the players from Acornbush United Amakhosi s Nedbank Cup opponents on Saturday having worked with them as youth players at Free State Stars.Lower-league Acornbush s colourful coach Macdonald Makhubedu pointed out that five or six of his players had been brought through as youth players at Stars when Komphela was coach there.Komphela confirmed this and said he had also done his research on a side who have nothing to lose in a dream Nedbank last-16 match against the country s glamour club at their 10 000-seater Kabokweni Stadium 30 kilometres outside Nelspruit. To profile such opponents is not as easy. And even at the back of your profile a lot could change in their favour or our favour Komphela said. Truly so there are a few players we know from them. I ve worked with them from when I was at Free State Stars Junior Nyathi Sifisi Thomo Madoda Motha. And there also some of their kids we are profiling we ve got information from our own players. Pule Ekstein was telling us Coach this one I ve worked with . And it is important to understand their qualities. But one thing we know is that this team cannot just beat a Premier League side if they are not serious. And they wouldn t have topped their (ABC Motsepe League Free State) log if they were not serious. So we are going there with the understanding that this is a serious match. One can only wish that come Sunday that stadium must be painted gold and black so that we can perform our duty. Chiefs had put pressure on the PSL to move the match to the 40 000-seater Mbombela Stadium in Nelpruit but Acornbush insisted on playing at their home ground.Makhubedu has pointed out his belief that the game will be far tougher for Amakhosi at Kabokweni.- TMG Digital
