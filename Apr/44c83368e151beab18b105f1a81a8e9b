Haiti s President Jovenel Moise has slammed as terrorists the unidentified attackers who hurled stones at his motorcade late Saturday. There are no words strong enough to express the ignominy of these terrorist acts, a statement from his office said. Supporters of the president reported that his motorcade was targeted as it moved through the town of Arcahaie north of the capital Port-au-Prince. The town has been regularly rocked for almost two years by residents demonstrating against a redistricting decision by the former president. In July 2015 then-president Michel Martelly issued a decreee to split the town into two districts, enraging locals. The statement condemned the rock-throwing as acts endangering the life of the President of the Republic. Apart from political protests, Haiti is struggling to recover from the world s most significant recent cholera outbreak, with an estimated 30,000 cases expected this year. The Caribbean nation, the poorest country in the Americas, is also grappling with the aftermath of a January 2010 earthquake, with tens of thousands of people still living in tents without proper sanitation.
