Combining caffeine-loaded energy drinks with alcohol ups the odds of injury through falling, tripping or being hurt in a car crash, a new study has warned.Researchers at Canada's Victoria University recently analysed the results of 13 prior studies. They found that most reported a higher rate of injury when alcohol was paired with energy drinks compared to drinking alcohol alone.The study - published in the latest edition of the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs - has prompted the SA National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence to issue a warning against the potent combination, saying the physical consequences were often underestimated.The researchers found that 10 out of the 13 studies they probed showed a link between the use of alcohol mixed with energy drinks and an increased risk of injury compared to drinking just alcohol.The study said: "It has been estimated that the number of emergency department visits involving energy drinks nearly doubled between 2007 and 2011, with 13%-16% of these admissions related to alcohol mixed with energy drinks.Sanca's Adrie Vermeulen said: "The high caffeine content of energy drinks is a central nervous stimulant and alcohol is the opposite, namely a central nervous depressant that acts as a sedative."The energy drink helps a person 'sober up' and they don't realise the extent of their intoxication."Vermeulen said the combination could put a strain on a person's vital organs.
