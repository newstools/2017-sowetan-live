Free State Stars coach Serame Letsoaka believes the team will survive relegation.Ea Lla Koto only have the league to focus on now following their Nedbank Cup exit after they were thumped 4-1 by Orlando Pirates at James Motlatsi Stadium at the weekend.Letsoaka previously played for the club and in their fight to evade the dreaded relegation axe, he says it stands him in good stead that he knows the club well."You know the culture and you know the philosophy of the team. You know the supporters and you know the management, the people who are running the team as opposed to you going to other teams where you have to learn a lot of things," said Letsoaka, who replaced the Italian Giovanni Solinas in January."That's why I could take the risk to go coach the club in the middle of the season."Like I [previously] said, I will never coach a club in the middle of the season but I know the environment here," he said.Stars were outplayed by Pirates in the Ke Yona clash, a team they had beaten 3-2 in the league the previous week.The former Bafana Bafana assistant coach is not disheartened though, and he's focused on their league clash against Baroka at Peter Mokaba Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm)."We are looking at making sure the team is not relegated. Once that has been achieved, maybe the secondary achievement will be being in the top eight," Letsoaka added.
