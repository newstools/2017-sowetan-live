At Kabokweni Stadium - A late Gustavo Paez brace rescued Kaizer Chiefs from another embarrassing defeat by a lower division side in the Nedbank Cup when they beat ABC Motsepe League side Acornbush United 2-1 at Kabokweni Stadium on Sunday afternoon.Having previously been knocked out by Baroka FC who were in the third tier back in 2011 Amakhosi came from a goal down to win in front of a good crowd at this venue.Acornbush took a surprise lead just before half time when Rhulani Sidumo headed home from a cross whipped in by Mduduzi Nkosi.They took this lead even after they were minus midfielder Sandy Nyathi who was sent off for a tackle on Willard Katsande just before the half hour mark.Sensing trouble Chiefs brought on Paez at the start of the second half for left back Sibusiso Khumalo.It was a great move as Paez bagged a brace in the final 15 minutes to send Amakhosi to the quarterfinals.There was huge relief from Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela who needs silverware this season. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
