Pitso Mosimane is not having sleepless nights over Mamelodi Sundowns' poor run of form, which was extended to six matches without a win after their Nedbank Cup exit at the weekend.After their 1-0 defeat to Golden Arrows at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday, Sundowns now have the Absa Premiership as the only domestic competition to compete for this season. They are currently in fifth place ahead of their crucial Tshwane derby encounter against SuperSport United at Loftus Stadium on Thursday (6pm)."We will try again on Thursday. Maybe we can try to win one game and then everything will turn around," he said."There is time. You must remember there was one stage we were 11 points behind in 2013/14 and I think you know what happened [Sundowns won the league]. I'm not saying that will happen again, but you have to look at the positives."Mosimane, meanwhile, said he feels he is not protected by the Premier Soccer League after Arrows chief executive Gordon Masondo went to celebrate the victory in the Sundowns coach's technical area. There was a bit of a scuffle after the game, but it was resolved before it got out of hand. Recently Mosimane almost had an incident with the Kaizer Chiefs security personnel at FNB Stadium, which prompted Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela to apologise."You saw what happened against Chiefs and you saw Masondo came to my technical area to cause a problem. Maybe there's a plot against me. People putting their people to come at me. I feel unprotected and when I react, I'm a loose canon or I'm not thinking," he said.
