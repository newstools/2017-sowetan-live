Bulls and Springbok centre Jan Serfontein s disillusionment with life at the Bulls is believed to be behind his decision not to accept a new contract offer from SA Rugby.Serfontein the 2012 Junior World Player of the Year has a dual contract with SA Rugby and the Bulls and was recently offered new terms. But he has opted not to sign on beyond the current October 31 expiry even though he does not have a club next season.He has been linked to several French clubs. An SA Rugby spokesperson confirmed that Serfontein was offered an improved contract but he declined the deal. "The player informed the parties concerned of his desire to explore playing opportunities abroad and in view of this Jan has therefore opted not to renew the national contract offered to him SA Rugby said in a short statement. Serfontein s career appears to have stalled at the Bulls where a combination of injury and playing in losing Super Rugby teams have stifled his growth. Although he has played 26 Tests and was a member of the 2015 World Cup squad when he replaced injured skipper Jean de Villiers Serfontein has not quite reached his full potential. But he is only 25 and if he plays four more Tests in the coming international season he will reach the 30-cap mark which is the cutoff for overseas-based players to be selected for the Springboks. The Bulls did not comment. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
