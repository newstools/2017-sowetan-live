Settling in at Orlando Pirates was a breeze for Dove Wome, but he's far from happy.Wome has three goals in seven appearances for the Buccaneers since arriving on loan from SuperSport United in January.But with the team struggling in 11th place after 21 matches, Wome believes he can do more to help them get away from the relegation zone.Pirates are just five points ahead of bottom side, Baroka."I have settled in because I have some players I played with at other clubs (like Thabo Matlaba, Mpho Makola and Ayanda Gcaba, all at Free State Stars)," Wome said yesterday."I'm happy to be getting game time but not happy with the performance. I can feel at the end of every game that I have to give more, that's why I say I'm not happy," Wome said."I have to help the team in many ways. I can help them defend, create and score goals."The 25-year-old was talking to us after a training session at Rand Stadium in preparation for Saturday's Nedbank Cup last 16 clash against Free State Stars. This is the same team they lost 3-2 to in a league match last weekend.Pirates are desperate to do well in the Nedbank Cup considering that's their realistic opportunity for silverware, but must also win games to avoid fighting relegation."It's tough. We don't want to fight relegation. If we get one win in the league, it is going to be okay. Of course there is pressure because a big team like this should be winning games," Wome added.
