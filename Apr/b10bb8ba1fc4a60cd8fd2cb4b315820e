Beauty Maribe looks back on the events of April 11 2001 with sadness. Part of that sadness stems from the fact that she was supposed to accompany her nephew Mduduzi Thomo to watch the Soweto Derby between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs at Ellis Park Stadium. She was put off by the thought of how packed it would be.That didn t deter Thomo. He went there straight after work and wouldn t return home.The then 27-year-old from Jabulani in Soweto lost his life along with 42 other people in the stampede. We didn t sleep that night Maribe recalls. When my sister (Lindi Thomo Gabaza) called me to tell me that Mduduzi is no more we couldn t sleep."She got transport to come to the stadium at night to see him."We never had that chance. I only saw the picture of the bodies on the newspapers."It was a sombre day. He was a quiet person who loved football."Most of the times when he went to the stadium I would go with him."But for some reason I didn t go with him that day. Maybe I would also be dead. I had a ticket for that match. That tragic day didn t put off Maribe and her family from watching football live. I still go to the stadium she said. The ones that I go with now are still young."They love Pirates a lot. Mduduzi was also a Pirates fans. Everyone in our household supports them."I go with them even at night but mainly at Orlando Stadium because it s close to us. Before Maribe could finish that sentence her sister Mduduzi s mother interjected. Even though they don t care about us we are still Pirates fans Lindi said.Mduduzi worked in the same factory as his mother.He knocked off at 16h30 and rushed to the stadium.That would be the last time that his mother saw him alive. When his nephews are old enough I will tell them what happened to their uncle at Ellis Park " Maribe said."That their uncle died at the stadium watching his team."I don t want to tell them now because it could spoil their appetite to go to the stadium. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
