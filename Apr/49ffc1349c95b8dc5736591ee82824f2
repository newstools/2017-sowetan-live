Matters became heated between investigating officer Captain Kanna Swanepoel and the man representing murder accused Christopher Panayiotou as cross-examination resumed in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Wednesday morning.Advocate Terry Price SC said Swanepoel wanted the court to believe that everyone was a liar except him.He said Swanepoel visited Luthando Siyoni the man who previously confessed to helping arrange Jayde Panayiotou s murder in custody one night and destroyed the consultation notes taken down by his attorney at the time Ryno Scholtz by flushing them down the toilet.Swanepoel responded that this was definitely not true. I don t know where Mr Price gets his information from. Price said further that Swanepoel tried to convince co-accused Sinethemba Nemembe and Zolani Sibeko to use an attorney of his choice.A composed Swanepoel said this was laughable .Testimony continues.
