Orlando Pirates cannot afford to continue conceding "stupid" goals if they are to start doing well again.Realistically, the Buccaneers only have the Nedbank Cup to play for this season, where they meet Free State Stars in the last 16 at James Motlatsi Stadium on Saturday.As far as the league is concerned, they are positioned 11th and will have to fight for a top eight finish.Bucs mentor Kjell Jonevret, pictured, was frank in his assessment after the 3-2 league defeat to Free State Stars at the weekend. "I think we did a few mistakes, stupid mistakes that we haven't done in the games before, and now it's a step back," he said."We have to remind each other about what we did well in the first four games that we played ... hopefully, we will have a better result on Saturday."The Swede has no concerns about playing Ea Lla Koto again, especially in the latter's home ground.On the contrary, Jonevret said his players will be motivated to dim the stars this time.
