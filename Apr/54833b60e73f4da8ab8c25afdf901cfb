Luc Eymael says his life would be in danger if he were to return to Polokwane City, as he revealed that he would be appealing against the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber's decision.Eymael was ordered to go back to City by the DRC, just over a month after signing for Bloemfontein Celtic.Eymael resigned from City on March 9 and was announced as a Celtic coach a day later. Aggrieved by the move, City filed an interdict to stop the coach from sitting on the bench for Celtic and it was successful. After a few weeks of attending hearings, Eymael was ordered to go back to City but says there is no chance of that happening.The Belgian fears for his life and referred to the drama at Peter Mokaba Stadium early this month when he was manhandled by City officials."I'm not happy. It's very unfair and not humane. We are going to appeal," said Eymael yesterday."I will never go back to Polokwane. I have a family and I am here [in South Africa] to work, not to be in a war. We saw the true Polokwane City at the stadium. How can you tell someone to go back and risk his life? Nobody can be obliged to work where he is uncomfortable. The relationship is broken."The outspoken Eymael went on: "There have been lies in this judgment. What I heard during this judgement was so many lies. But I trust in God. The truth will come out."Eymael reiterated that he did not resign from City to join Celtic but his relationship with City chairman Johnny Mogaladi had reached boiling point."I did not resign to come to Celtic. I don't know when people will understand this. I had a lot of offers before I signed with Celtic. I resigned because I was not comfortable and there were things I could not agree with. When it became too much, I had to leave," he said.
