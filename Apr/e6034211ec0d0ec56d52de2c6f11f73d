ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe's explanation that it was incorrect for the party's top leaders to publicly disagree with President Jacob Zuma this week went unchallenged.He gave the explanation at a media briefing following the ANC extended national working committee (NWC) meeting.This was after Zuma during the meeting apologised to the NWC on behalf of the top officials about how they had handled the cabinet reshuffle matter.The apology is an indication that the officials decided to present a united front to the meeting which was held on Tuesday. However, the division among the top six remains.Zuma was told bluntly that the ANC rules demand that he consult even though he has the constitutional prerogative to hire and fire ministers.In essence Mantashe did not apologise for opposing Zuma, but he indicated it was wrong to differ publicly as leaders.So what does this mean?Are we to believe that Mantashe is a spineless coward, ready to roll over and die in the face of Zuma and his forces as has been claimed by his detractors? Methinks not.Mantashe has publicly called ANC leader and Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane a liar after she claimed that he was forced to climb down and apologise to Zuma in the Tuesday meeting.Let me quote Mantashe: "Let me put it diplomatically, she is being economical with the truth."Mokonyane made the claims at an ANC Youth League rally in Germiston, an event Zuma was forced to abandon because of poor attendance.Mantashe also made it clear at the press conference that the fake intelligence report used as part of the reason for firing finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas was for Zuma to explain.In the NWC meeting Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said the fake intelligence report reminded him of some years back when he was accused of plotting against former president Thabo Mbeki. This is a point Ramaposa also made publicly.Granted Mantashe is not the most eloquent of communicators but as secretary-general he has to communicate decisions that he does not agree with, that is how the ANC works.Before the ANC lost three key metros last year, all the factions in the ANC could afford to speak in code as they slugged it out for power.This is because they were guaranteed victory at the polls.That is no longer the case. Those like Mantashe, Ramaphosa, Zweli Mkhize and others know that it is Zuma who is costing the party and causing its electoral decline. They have also drawn the battle lines with their forthright opposition to his blunders.They now have no choice but to remove him. Otherwise the electorate will punish them.
