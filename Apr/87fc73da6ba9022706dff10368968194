A mark of a champion team is how they find quality to replace quality. Mamelodi Sundown's Motjeka Madisha may not be everybody's cup of tea at centreback but in Wayne Arendse's absence it's about getting the job done. The Brazilians' excellent defensive organisation has seen them concede the least number of goals this season but Madisha's introduction has added a new element.As good as Madisha knows he will be in the future he is aware that being a starter in Sundowns' crack defensive unit requires a fair bit of patience.Having won the man-of-the-match award in last week's 1-0 win against SuperSport United Madisha is expected to play a crucial role in Sundowns' date with Ajax Cape Town at Loftus Versfeld on Tuesday.If Cape Town City and SuperSport United drop points against Kaizer Chiefs and Bidvest Wits respectively in what could be the Premier Soccer League's most crucial and exciting match-day this season Sundowns could go top on goal difference.Sundowns are fourth with 44 points with log leaders Cape Town City two points ahead. Chiefs and Wits are tied on 45 points with Wits ahead on goal difference. When I thought I was ready I was told I mustn't rush things and getting a national team call up wasn't a sign of me being ready " Madisha said."I'm happy they've encouraged me to keep pushing."I'm glad they've been there for me and pushing me. It's been an honour to work with coaches like Manqoba Mnqithi Pitso Mosimane and Rhulani Mokoena."They've been like fathers to me."They've been telling me to keep pushing because my time will come."When my opportunity does arrive I need to make the most of it and making sure that I can prove that I can play. While the national team is stocked with quality defenders like Chiefs' Erick Mathoho and Ajax's Rivaldo Coetzee Madisha knows he may have to wait his turn.Mathoho and Coetzee are still young but that bodes well for the national team's future.Madisha's old head on his 22-year-old shoulders also means Mosimane and company have their fingers on the pulse when it comes to a succession plan.Arendse Thabo Nthethe and Ricardo Nascimento aren't going to be around forever.Madisha is happy the time he's spent with the national team has accelerated his development. Being in the national team has helped me to be patient humble and being able to focus on my job."The best thing about playing for the national team is that it has firmed me up for the challenges I'm about to face with the club."It's also helped me in terms of game management Madisha said. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
