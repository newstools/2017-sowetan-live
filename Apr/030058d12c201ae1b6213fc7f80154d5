Kaizer Chiefs 2-2 draw with SuperSport United at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday night was a bitter pill to swallow for Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela as his club looked to take all three points.A late strike by Aubrey Modiba that deflected off the body of defender Tsepo Masilela into his own net undid all the club s work after two brilliant goals from captain Siphiwe Tshabalala. That draw felt like a defeat for a team that was looking to pick themselves up from back-to-back defeats that saw them eliminated in the Nedbank Cup and lose ground in the Absa Premiership. That draw didn t only hurt Chiefs but it also hurt Matsatsantsa a Pitori as their title ambitions took a heavy blow. It s disappointing based on how the game unfolded Komphela said. We had a lot of chances. Coming out with a point you say Jesus Christ we dropped two points. To be honest with respect to SuperSport we dropped two points. They must have been celebrating the draw. I thought that we undeservedly drew this match. We shouldn t have drawn this match. The draw means that Chiefs are four points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns who have two games in hand and SuperSport are in a worse situation with nine points behind the Brazilians having played a game more. This result effectively kicked Chiefs and Matsatsantsa out of the league race but the Tshwane side still has something to play for unlike Amakhosi. Our attitude now is to try and finish as high as we can SuperSport s assistant coach Kaitano Tembo. We need to take it game by game because it s not all lost. We still have to play in the semifinal of the Nedbank Cup and we are in the group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup.
