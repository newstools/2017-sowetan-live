It is not only Pitso Mosimane who is impressed with defender Motjeka Madisha's impressive recent form for Mamelodi Sundowns.Downs' MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) coach David Notoane has also registered his admiration for Madisha after his recent scintillating form in the first team, and he trusts that the defender's achievements will motivate other players in the academy to work even harder.Since Madisha made his senior debut in the Nedbank Cup tie against Mariveni United last month, he hasn't looked back."His maturity speaks volumes," said Notoane of the 22-year-old. "I was not surprised to see him doing well because I always knew that he was a talented boy. You hardly find a defender like him who is strong and comfortable on the ball as well."I have told other reserve league players to look up to him. Madisha's impressive form in the first team will help many players in the academy because they will want to emulate him and that will help our development structures to produce hard-working players," added the ex-Santos striker.Madisha helped the young Brazilians clinch the MDC title in February. Winning the local reserve league championship paved Notoane's boys a path to participate in the MultiChoice International Challenge, which they also won in Holland last month."During our Holland trip we learnt many things. Madisha's great displays are slightly influenced by what he assimilated while playing in the International Challenge. It was very developmental and beneficial to us," he added.
