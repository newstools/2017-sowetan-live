Former Polokwane City coach Luc Eymael said he anticipated the scuffle that overshadowed his return to Polokwane with Bloemfontein Celtic on Sunday.This after Eymael was prevented by City security from entering the dressing rooms as he waits for the PSL's Dispute Resolution Chamber to resolve his dispute with the club." The incident was unfortunate and regrettable. I knew beforehand that this altercation was going to happen but I kept my cool. I was shocked that I was ill-treated by people I know personally, this makes me sad," Eymael said.City chief executive Tincy Tema said: "His decision to leave the club abruptly did not sit well with some of the people in charge, especially the players and owners. We hope to resolve this matter amicably."
