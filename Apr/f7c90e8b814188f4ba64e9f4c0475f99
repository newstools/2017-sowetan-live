Zane Waddell lived up to his billing as a promising swimmer he dipped below 50 seconds in the 100m freestyle heats of the SA championships in Durban on Thursday morning. The US-based student s 49.99sec ranked him third behind Olympians Doug Erasmus and Brad Tandy who faced off in the same race.Erasmus clocked 49.85 and Tandy 49.90.Both are 50m freestyle specialists having represented SA in that event at the Rio Olympics last year with Tandy finishing tied for sixth in the final.But since the 2012 showpiece in London with the retirement of swimmers like Gideon Louw and Graeme Moore SA s depth in the 100m freestyle has diminished drastically.While the world s best are breaking 48 seconds easily SA swimmers especially at the national championships are struggling to break 50 seconds.The country s best is Chad Le Clos who went 48.64 in the 4x100m freestyle relay on Monday night although he scratched from the individual race.To qualify automatically for the world championships in Budapest in July swimming s world governing body Fina has stipulated a time of 48.93.But in a country like Australia where there is considerable depth the qualifying time for their national championships from Sunday to next Friday has been lowered to 48.49.SA s dearth of male freestylers comes after the country won the 4x100m freestyle relay gold at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and made the final at the next two Games at Beijing 2008 and London 2012. - TMG Digital
