Moroka Swallows relegation to the amateur leagues is a shame for South African football and a warning to other teams says Jomo Cosmos owner Jomo Sono.Sono said the collapse of the once-mighty Dube Birds to the obscurity of the SAB Leagues this past weekend where any recovery in the foreseeable future seems highly unlikely was a warning that no team can survive on reputation alone.He said his priority remains preserving the fortunes of Cosmos. It s football. African Wanderers are gone Witbank Black Aces are sold teams will come and go Sono said. We cannot cry over that. I have to worry about where Cosmos are going. Because Cosmos can also get there. I have to focus on Cosmos. And it s a shame. But all great teams do go down. Swallows demise from the Premier Soccer League in 2014-15 to further relegation from the National First Division last season then the ABC Motsepe League this season followed years of abysmal management of one of the original giants of SA football.Asked if Cosmos can take lessons from Swallows self-implosion Sono said: I wouldn t know because I don t know what was happening there."I can t learn anything from the failure of other people."You can only learn from your failures. Swallows were relegated from the Motsepe League with a 2-1 defeat to Orange Vaal Professionals on Saturday.Yoyo team Cosmos back and forth between the PSL and NFD in the past decade are currently in eighth place in the First Division. - TMG Digital/TMG Digital
