Of the four SA teams who took part in the CAF club competitions this year, you could have bet your house on Bidvest Wits bombing out first.That's because despite his recent proclamations of a supposed renewed interest, Gavin Hunt could hardly be bothered about his team doing well in these competitions.The Wits coach's dismissive attitude towards the CAF Champions League and the Confederation Cup is well documented. We first saw this blas approach from his days at SuperSport United, with whom he won three league titles in a row but surprisingly never contested for a place in the Champions League group phase.Infamously, Hunt fielded a weakened SuperSport team against Kampala City Council of Uganda in the second leg a 2009 Champions League first round tie, after losing the first 2-1. SuperSport drew 1-1 at home to bomb out 3-2. They went on to win the league that year, and Hunt must have praised his judgment thereafter.He may be thinking along the same lines this year, after Wits were eliminated from the Confederation Cup at the weekend by Smouha of Egypt, while SuperSport United and Platinum Stars progressed to the next phase.Wits, without a doubt, are in a greater position than other contenders - who include Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs and Cape Town City - to win a first Premiership title this season.But the prestige of winning a continental title can never be equated to domestic competitions.Hunt would do well to take his cue from Pitso Mosimane at Sundowns. The Brazilians' Champions League triumph was a major triumph for SA football, heralding several awards that this country's football fraternity had not seen before.Sundowns also got a chance to play in the Fifa Club World Cup - a first for a SA team - and while that could yet catch up with them due to fixture backlog and fatigue, winning the Champions League was all worth the trouble.There's no guarantee, however, of Hunt's attitude ending Wits' long wait for a title. He lost out last year and this season he saw his four-year stay at the club delivering a first trophy in the MTN8, beating Sundowns in the final."We'll be in the MTN8 again next year," Mosimane said following the defeat. "We have bigger fish to fry."Sadly for Wits, this kind of thinking doesn't apply to Hunt. Domestic comes first. But if he's to become a serious contender for the Bafana coaching post in future, as his fans - who include some in the media - contend, he will have to show a bit of interest in CAF competitions above success on the domestic front.
