Deep divisions plaguing the ANC over President Jacob Zuma's controversial cabinet reshuffle were laid bare when Struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada's memorial service in Durban was disrupted by ANC Youth League members yesterday.Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan who was the main speaker and ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, who publicly criticised the manner in which Zuma conducted the cabinet reshuffle, were booed by members of the ANCYL while addressing the audience in the packed Sastri College Hall.Both Gordhan and Mkhize were drowned out by ANCYL members who erupted into the song: "Awusitshele uZuma wenzeni?" [Please tell us what has Zuma done?] in an apparent reference to their criticism of the cabinet reshuffle.KZN ANC chairman and economic development MEC Sihle Zikalala had to intervene twice to try and calm the situation when Gordhan was drowned out by ANCYL boos.Gordhan seemed to have angered the ANCYL members when he told the audience that: "Unity can't be based on money. Unity can't be based on these brown bags that are moving around." He added: "If we can't unite among ourselves there is no hope for 2019. Stop corruption that erodes our economy. Let's work together so that we can build a future..."Mkhize said: "What we do today must not be allowed to erode the support base of the ANC. We are still the ANC even if we differ in our views."We're dealing with the issues that have caused the differences among yourselves."Ahmed Kathrada Foundation executive director Neeshan Balton said he was disappointed about the disruption of the memorial service.Zikalala said the behaviour by some members of the ANCYL was not acceptable and would be dealt with by the ANC.Political analyst Somadoda Fikeni said the ANC was in a phase where those holding different views were closed down."If the ANC does not assert its authority its national conference in December is actually going to degenerate into chaos," Fikeni said. - Additional reporting by Ngwako Modjadji
