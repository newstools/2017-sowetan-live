Free State Stars coach Serame Letsoaka aims to avoid extra-time in tomorrow's Nedbank Cup last 16 clash against Orla-ndo Pirates at the James Motlatsi Stadium (8.15pm).Last week, Ea Lla Koto outwitted Pirates 3-2 in a league encounter. Going into the cup tie, Letsoaka has now vowed to do everything in his power to win the game inside 90 minutes. A win for Letsoaka's charges would guarantee a third successive barren campaign for relegation candidates Pirates."No one likes extra-time. We want to kill the game off in normal time. We cannot afford to play another extra 30 minutes, considering that we are playing again on Tuesday [against Baroka]," he said yesterday.The former Ea Lla Koto defender trusts that winning against big teams helps players' confidence."The boys are looking forward to this Pirates game. When you win games of this magnitude, players' morale gets boosted," he said.It will not be the first time the Buccaneers take on Stars in the "Ke Yona" competition.In 2012, an extra-time strike by ex-Bucs player Paulus Masehe sent the Soweto giants packing after Edward Manqele had put the Free State-based outfit ahead before Daine Klate levelled matters.Stars won the tie 2-1.Elsewhere, Chippa United hope to put their 4-1 league humiliation by Cape Town City behind them when the Chilli Boys host Polokwane City in tomorrow's second round match at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium (3pm) in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape.
