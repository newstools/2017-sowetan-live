Student advertised new laptop on social media in exchange for a televisionThe National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) is waging a war against students who are defrauding it.Some students are using their allowances to purchase things like books for other students in exchange for money.The scheme said it had received reports of the alleged fraud from eight institutions across the country, and had so far blocked and suspended the accounts of two students who were found guilty of selling their allowances .NSFAS spokesman Kagisho Mamabolo said the scheme had received reports from witnesses, victims and whistle-blowers. The two students were from the University of Venda. Students have been found openly selling or exchanging their allowances on social media where they would buy books for a student with their sBux allowance in exchange for cash at a discounted rate. The most recent case has been of a student who used their sBux book allowance to purchase a laptop which is allowed as it will be used for their academic activities, however, the student advertised the new laptop on social media in exchange for a television. sBux is a system whereby NSFAS loads money onto a student s cellphone to pay for books, accommodation and food through vouchers instead of hard cash.Mamabolo saidthe allowance could only be used by a student who is funded by NSFAS to pay for goods required to support them academically.He said the funds for the two students would be suspended until the next academic year and they would have to explain in writing to the scheme why they should be considered for allowances in the next cycle if they qualify.He said that only their book allowance had been recalled and not the accommodation and food allowances. The selling or exchanging of allowances is in violation of the allowance terms and conditions written in the agreement form signed by students who receive these funds. On average, a student can have an allowance ranging from R10000 to R50000 per annum loaded in the sBux.The allowance is allocated to students according to their financial needs as reported to NSFAS by their institutions and supplied by students through the NSFAS applications forms, Mamabolo said.Students implicated in the alleged fraud were from Unisa, Ekurhuleni East Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) college, King Hints TVET college, Umfolozi TVET college, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, University of Venda, Durban University of Technology and Motheo TVET college.Mamabolo said they were investigating other case
