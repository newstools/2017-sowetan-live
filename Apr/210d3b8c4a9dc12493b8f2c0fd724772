Tomorrow's march by opposition parties presents an opportunity to debunk the "misleading" narrative the downgrade of the country's economy to junk status won't affect the poor and working class.This, according to EFF leader Julius Malema, who, along with eight other leaders of opposition parties, yesterday briefed the media on the anti-President Jacob Zuma march.The march to the Union Buildings comes barely a week after several civil society movements staged marches around the country against Zuma.The president is being blamed for plunging the country's economy into junk status. Anti-Zuma marches racism against blacks says Zuma A number of Zuma's allies have subsequently claimed that the majority of the country's population should not be bothered by these downgrades.Malema said opposition parties should not worry so much about the no-confidence vote in parliament next week, but about whether the masses were on their side."... Are the masses really grasping what we're fighting? Do they understand how [the junk status] will affect them?"Once borrowing becomes expensive, it means bread is going to be expensive. And you are saying an ordinary person must not be bothered by that?"He insisted that whites were not being racist when making noise about the downgrades because they may understand it better than black people."It has got nothing to do with race."United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa said their march tomorrow was just the start of a rolling mass action that will not stop until Zuma was removed."Our mission is very clear. It's directed to the president who has violated the Constitution of this country."Isaac Mahamba, spokesman of the Tshwane metro police department, confirmed the parties have been granted permission to march.nkosib@sowetan.co.za
