The standoff between the Active Citizens Movement (ACM) and the ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal over struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada s memorial service is once again going to the courts after the league failed to apologise for disrupting the service.The ACM said in a statement on Wednesday that it was preparing contempt of court proceedings against the ANCYL for refusing to apologise after its members disrupted Kathrada s memorial service two weeks ago during which former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and ANC treasurer general Zweli Mkhize were booed.This comes after the body went to the Durban High Court and won an order allowing the league to attend the memorial under condition that it did not disrupt proceedings.The organisers of the service had written to the youth league demanding an unconditional apology to Kathrada s family itself and the people of South Africa.They had also demanded a written undertaking that the league will not disrupt its future meetings or threaten any of its members.Another demand was that the youth league identify the disruptive members and institute disciplinary proceedings against such members.The ANC s youth wing had been told to apologise in two Sunday papers including the Sunday Times and two regional daily papers but it failed to do so.Instead the ANCYL issued a statement on Saturday saying it had received communication from the ACM and had in turn proposed a meeting to find a solution to the matter.ACM spokeswoman Yashica Padia confirmed on Wednesday that their lawyer had not received a response from the youth league to its demands and has said it will not meet with them unless a written apology has been provided.
