The Democratic Alliance on Friday afternoon launched an urgent application in the High Court in Cape Town to stop Zuma s newly appointed ministers from being sworn in on Friday evening.Counsel for the DA questioned why President Jacob Zuma sacked Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan but retained Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini.Anton Katz acting for the DA said: It can never be said that it is in the interest of this country to give the keys to the treasury to the Guptas. James Selfe the DA s chairman of the federal executive said his party wants the swearing in postponed until Zuma s decision is reviewed or the motion of no confidence against him is debated in parliament. The decision is profoundly irrational in the first instance said Selfe. It is probably illegal in the second instance. But more than anything it is cataclysmic for the South African economy and for its people .It is just bad bad. Ismail Jammie SC for the president dismissed the court action as the DA s unhappiness with the finance minister .He added: Mr Gordhan will not lose his position now. He lost it in the morning. He said Gigaba does not require swearing in as he been moved sideways.
