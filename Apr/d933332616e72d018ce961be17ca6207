Like previous years, the Department of Home Affairs will extend its operating hours at selected ports of entry to cater for Easter holiday travellers.Newly appointed minister Hlengiwe Mkhize said the extended hours would be effective from April 11 to 19. "These reinforcements will apply to 10 high-volume ports of entry in anticipation of increased numbers of travellers."She said the top 10 ports by volume of arrivals and departures were OR Tambo International Airport, Beit Bridge, Lebombo, Maseru Bridge, Ficksburg, Oshoek, Cape Town International Airport, Kopfontein, Ramatlabama and Golela.She said that with increasing traveller volumes over this period, it was imperative that staff as well as border ports were well prepared to facilitate traveller movement and to mitigate transgressions."A comprehensive operational plan to support port operations is in place," Mkhize said.
