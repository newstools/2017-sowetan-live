Former South African captain Graeme Smith must be careful not to jinx the Proteas ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy to be held in the United Kingdom in June.Speaking exclusively to the ICC website Smith said when he looks at the current Proteas ODI side he struggles to find a weak link as there are lots of quality options with both the ball and the bat. One unfortunate reality for all South African players is the tag that accompanies them at any tournament " Smith said."It s been nearly two decades since South Africa have won a major ODI tournament and the question of just why that is gets thrown at you a hundred times in every press conference you do. The players will have to deal with that and remind themselves that they were not far away in 2015."This is a side that fans love to watch with some of the best players in the world and it may well be that bit of luck that will get them over the line. The Proteas are scheduled to play three ODIs against England before the start of the Champions Trophy and Smith believes it will be ideal preparation for the tournament. The three games against England in May will help the players acclimatise to English pitches and conditions ahead of the first ball of the tournament."It s important that they play those games as close to tournament intensity as possible said Smith. Tournaments are tough by nature from ball one you have to play your best cricket to progress."Playing the host nation just before the tournament with the quality they have at their disposal will be a good indication of how ready the players are to try and end the drought in terms of ODI competitions. South Africa have won 14 of their last 16 ODIs and Smith said they will be high on confidence as they embark on the three-match tour of England which will also serve as preparation for the tournament. The nucleus of the side have stepped up since the World Cup by helping the team to win 14 of their last 16 ODIs which means the players will be full of confidence as they embark on the tour."Quinton De Kock has led the charge superbly from a batting perspective and he s just one of several very exciting cricketers who ve helped support AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis."The bowlers have also shown their increased ability to break partnerships and be dangerous on different surfaces something that will be key to succeeding in English conditions. Smith also mentioned the spinner Imran Tahir as one of the players who will add a lot of value to the side and he also expects a lot from the likes of Wayne Parnell and Farhaan Behardien. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
