A storm is brewing over what the SA Football Association (Safa) has said is an illegal coaching course. But it turns out Safa's technical director Neil Tovey's name is being bandied about in the matter.Safa warned coaches of courses run by Scottish national Justin Behrens."Safa wishes to warn aspiring coaches and members of the public that under no circumstance has the association been in talks with the Scottish Football Association to collaborate on such programme in SA. The individual is bogus," said Safa in a statement."We will take legal action against him if he goes on with his bogus coaching courses," Safa's spokesman Dominic Chimhavi warned.But Behrens said: "Tovey endorsed our programme in July. I have met him twice at Safa House. Nothing is illegal..."When Sowetan contacted Tovey, he said: "I do not want to talk about this issue but I can tell you that we are trying to sort it out. We were not happy about certain things and our deal with him [Behrens] hit a snag."
