Against Smouha, the starting 11 was almost the same as the one he used against Cosmos.Five of the players who started in the defeat to Ezenkosi were Moeneeb Josephs, Bongani Khumalo, Phumlani Ntshangase, Siboniso Gaxa and Cuthbert Malajila.Sifiso Myeni came off the bench and proved a constant threat to the Smouha defence but his brilliant touches counted for nothing as the home side failed to record a goal.l Platinum Stars suffered a 0-2 first leg defeat to AS Tanda in Abidjan, Ivory Coast last night, while SuperSport United got a crucial away goal in their 1-1 draw with Liberia's Barrack Young Controllers in Monrovia.The return leg for a spot in the Confederation Cup group phase is this weekend.
