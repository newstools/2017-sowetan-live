Winger Thabo Rakhale couldn't have asked for a better return to the Orlando Pirates starting XI."Jomo" made his long-awaited comeback when he played 120 minutes in Pirates' 2-1 win over Bloemfontein Celtic in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals at Orlando Stadium this weekend.Coincidentally, his last match had been against Celtic in December when Pirates lost 2-1 in the league at the same venue before a groin strain halted him."It's a great feeling to be back in the team. We have been doing well in the past few games," said Rakhale, who provided the assist for Thamsanqa Gabuza to head home the winner against Phunya Sele Sele. Abbubaker Mobara had opened the scoring for Bucs, before Kabelo Mahlasela sent the match into extra-time."I would like to thank the coach (Kjell Jonevret) for believing in me and playing me in such a big game. I'm happy to be back," he said.The 27-year-old believes Bucs can redeem themselves from their poor form earlier in the season to finish with silverware this season."I think now we are going back to the Pirates that people know; a team that plays good football with a winning mentality," Rakhale reckoned."Everyone is happy in the team and the mood is very high. If everyone can give his best, we will go far," he added.Jonevret, meanwhile, was surprised that Rakhale was able to play for two hours on his return. "I was surprised that he was running for the full 120 minutes, even though you could see he looked rusty at times. I'm very happy for him," the coach said.
