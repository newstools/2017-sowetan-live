SuperSport United do not play to win frustrated Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt complained after his side s 1-0 Absa Premiership defeat at Bidvest Stadium on Tuesday night came as a blow to his side s title chances.Hunt said his side had pressed for a win while SuperSport had tried not to lose.A defensive blunder by Wits experienced centreback Buhle Mkhwanazi saw the ball given to Thabo Mnyamane who squared for Thuso Phala to chip a 68th-minute winner over Moeneeb Josephs.The defeat ended a run of five unbeaten league games for the Clever Boys who dropped from second to third on a night when their biggest title rivals leaders Cape Town City and now-second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns both won. I thought we did all the playing and the pressing we tried to win the game and unfortunately we were caught with a horrendous error Hunt said. We tried to play and win the game and ended up losing the game so it s disappointing from that perspective. There s nothing we can do we ve just got to try and dust ourselves down and start again. Of course it hurts us."It s two games that we ve played SuperSport (and lost in the PSL in 2016-17) we re still five points above them and we re going to end up above them. But they don t play to win. So it s frustrating to lose a game like that by making an error like that. We tried to push the whole game. So we re disappointed. The concern is we haven t scored from open play for four or five games now. Wits have scored from open play two goals by Mogakolodi Ngele in a 3-0 home PSL win against Golden Arrows in one of their last five league and continental matches. It s been a problem. We scored from a penalty last week."We didn t score in Egypt (against Smouha on the Caf Confederation Cup) we didn t score in the Egypt game before that Hunt said. So it s just concerning. It s just that players in the right place in the final third haven t done the business. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
