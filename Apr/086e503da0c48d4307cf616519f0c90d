Netball SA president Mimi Mthethwa has pleaded with government to provide more resources to fast-track the development of netball in the country."We know that government does not specifically sponsor a [netball] professional league, instead they allocate money to advance sports at grass roots," Mthethwa said at the launch of the Brutal Fruit Netball Premier League (BFNPL) yesterday."At the moment we only receive R2-million and it is not enough because we have to cater for schools as part of grass roots development and also run our administration," she added.Not only will the fourth edition of the BFNPL be the most competitive, but this year's edition comes with a major bonus for the eventual champions.The campaign starts tomorrow and concludes on June 11. It will be played in Durban, Cape Town and Bloemfontein.The 10 teams are Limpopo Baobabs, Gauteng North Jaguars, Gauteng Golden Fireballs, North West Flames, Mpumalanga Sunbirds, Northern Cape Diamonds, Free State Crinums, KwaZulu-Natal Kingdom Stars, Eastern Cape Aloes and Western Cape Southern Stings.
