Steve Komphela has apologised to Pitso Mosimane following a skirmish with a Chiefs security guard after the match on Saturday."He's a coach and a colleague. We know football is a game of emotions, but you try your utmost best to stay upright irrespective of the circumstances. Our security personnel got close to the coach [Mosimane], did not maintain his official distance and clearly something happened. I wish to apologise." Mosimane has accepted the apology. Bring on big five, says KomphelaKaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has embraced the challenge of competing for the Absa Premiership championship with more contenders than in a two-horse race.At least five teams each stand a good chance of clinching the league title.Chiefs are second on the log following their 2-1 win over Mamelodi Sundowns at FNB Stadium at the weekend.Log leaders Bidvest Wits, Cape Town City and SuperSport United are the other teams that are in the chase for the honours.Bernard Parker and an own goal by Bangaly Soumahoro saw Amakhosi fight back from a goal down after Khama Billiat had put the visitors ahead on Saturday."It's the beauty of the PSL. There has been some great football played in the PSL and the top five teams, as is, you still don't know who's going to win the championship. What else would you want? Would you want a scenario of Real Madrid and Barcelona clear [at the top of the log] or five? Let it be five," said Komphela.Key to Chiefs' title ambitions would be their 12th man - the supporters, who came out in big numbers on Saturday night."Our mission is to make it a point that we please these supporters," he said."They are the ones who keep us going."Chiefs will switch focus to the Nedbank Cup when they face Acornbush United at Kabokweni Stadium in Mpumalanga on Sunday.
