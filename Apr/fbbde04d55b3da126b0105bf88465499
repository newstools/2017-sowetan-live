The boy who had attacked another pupil with a brick at a top Western Cape school could be suspended.A video of a Grade 9 boy at Stellenberg High School in Durbanville attacking another child exploded online about a month ago.Millicent Merton of the provincial education department confirmed that the school governing body recommended the expulsion after conducting a disciplinary process. I must be noted that only the head of education may approve expulsion. This process is still underway said Merton.When asked about rumours that the victim had allegedly been bullying his attacker she replied: I am not in a position to comment on or confirm any disciplinary action against the other learner. When TimesLive initially reported about the attack the father of the victim refused to comment because he felt the incident was being blown out of proportion. You choose what you want to write I have nothing more to say on this the man said.
