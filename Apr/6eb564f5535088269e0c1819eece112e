Once touted as SA's future middle and long distance star, Gladwin Mzazi admits he has yet to reach his true potential.But the 28-year-old says it's about time he steps out from the shadows of Stephen Mokoka and Elroy Gelant, the pair he knows well on and off the track by virtue of being his former training partners and direct competition.Now a month under the guidance of the late Mbulaeni Mulaudzi's coach JP van der Merwe, Mzazi is picking up the pieces as he builds up to the Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathon with his eyes firmly fixed on the 21km top three finish in Cape Town on Saturday."It's about time now because I've always set the pace for the two guys only to lose towards the end of the race," said Mzazi, who runs in the colours of the Boxer Athletics Club.He is actually on the comeback trail after an injury-ravaged spell."I've been out, injured for six months, and I recently ran my first 10km after recovering from a stress fracture."I'm getting there and I feel good leading up to my third Two Oceans half marathon," Mzazi said, adding that his target at the Easter weekend flagship race was to better his previous positions.He came third in 2014 and seventh in 2015. Mzazi, however, said his ultimate goal was to return to the track for middle distance events so he can vie for a berth in Team SA for the IAAF World Championships in London in August.Elsewhere, Desmond Mokgobu came 12th at the Rotterdam Marathon in a personal best effort of 2:10:51, also yesterday. With these times, both athletes have provisionally qualified for the 42km race at the world championships in in August.
