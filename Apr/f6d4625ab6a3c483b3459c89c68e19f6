Freedom Park residents breathed a sigh of relief yesterday as their local clinic working hours were extended.Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba announced the extension of the clinic's operating hours by a further six hours on weekdays.Resident Bonginkosi Ndlovu said he nearly lost his son due to the poor healthcare facilities in the area. "We brought our baby when he was five weeks. The doctor told us to go back home because the baby was fine. Instead he said we were overfeeding him... The child's condition got worse, then we rushed him to [another clinic and] they transferred us to Baragwanath Hospital. Our child was diagnosed with bronco-pneumonia and spent seven days there; he's just come back [home]."Malehlohonolo Malele said she was happy about the extended hours as she will not have to travel far to access medical assistance. "I am happy because you can come [here] even on a weekend, previously we had to go to [Diepkloof, Soweto] on weekends."But Boipelo Mathikge wasn't so optimistic even though she said the new hours might ease their healthcare frustrations.Mashaba said: ". operating hours... will be extended to ... 7.30am to 10pm on weekdays and 7.30 am to 1.30pm on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. There will be full-time security to assist the staff, but we appeal to the community to please assist us in the fight against criminal elements because without them we cannot beat crime."Other clinics that will be extending their operating hours include Hikensile, Randburg, Zandspruit and Albert Street.
