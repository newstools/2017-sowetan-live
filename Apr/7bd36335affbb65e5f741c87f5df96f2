Mamelodi Sundowns' misfiring forwards will again be in the spotlight when they face Golden Arrows at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (3pm).Being a cup competition - Sundowns meet Arrows in the last 16 of the Nedbank Cup - they will have to find their scoring boots again to reach the last eight of Ke Yona.Sundowns have scored just four goals in their last five matches in all competitions, which has culminated in their slump especially in the race for the league title.Some have suggested that forward Khama Billiat's recent absence was a factor. The Zimbabwean missed seven games through a knee injury, but has since played two matches against Kaizer Chiefs, in which he scored in a 2-1 loss, and in the goalless draw against Bloemfontein Celtic in midweek.Billiat admitted that there was pressure to start scoring goals again. "For every game I always have pressure for myself and I have to perform to my best. Secondly, we always have people that are behind us the whole time [the supporters] and that is pressure on its own."It's like that and I can't control what people think or see. People can say whatever they want, but at the end of the day we just need to do the business in the pitch," Billiat said."I just need to work a little bit harder and just try to score more goals and help the team."Equally confident of a turnaround is another forward, Themba Zwane, who has seemingly also lost his scoring boots."We've been in this situation before and we know how to handle it," said the Bafana Bafana midfielder, who last scored against Platinum Stars in February."We are professional enough to pull up our socks and soldier on. We are getting chances, but we are not scoring . I'm lacking in terms of finishing, and that's where I need to improve," he said.Abafana Bes'thende, meanwhile, will be looking for revenge when they take on the Brazilians.When the two sides last met, Sundowns hammered Arrows 3-0 in a league match back in November.
