The honeymoon is over for Mamelodi Sundowns as the champions' struggles continue.This is coach Pitso Mosimane s sobering assessment of the club's current situation in the Absa Premiership after managing just three points from a possible 15 following a goalless draw against Bloemfontein Celtic on Wednesday night.Mosimane admitted they are going through a rough patch but added that it is still too early for the club's fans to start reaching for the panic buttons yet. Last year we did very well and that was a honeymoon " he said."Now times are tough and we have to accept that."We are facing adversity and it is going to test our character. While acknowledging Sundowns' struggles Mosimane was quick to add that he cannot lambaste his players just months winning the African Champions League and the CAF Super Cup. We are not winning and the players are dropping their heads " Mosimane said."But I told them that they must break the ice."It is tough times this is football and these things happen."I remember in December we scored five against Highlands Park four against Free State Stars three against Golden Arrows and six against Orlando Pirates."Those days are gone but we still have something to play for in the remainder of the season. If the possibility of retaining the league becomes difficult in the coming weeks Mosimane said that they will set their sights on finishing second to guarantee Champions League football next year. In the next four league games we need to fight and see if we can t go to the top which is something that we can still do."But the day I see that it is not going to happen I will look at it differently and try to fight for second position and go back to the Champions League. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
