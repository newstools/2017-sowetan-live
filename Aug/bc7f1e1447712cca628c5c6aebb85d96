As South Africa s home-based athletes flew into London on Tuesday morning the greatest Olympic stadium on earth yawned emptily as workers made the final touches ahead of the world championships on Friday.The fans turned this structure into a vibrant organism during the 2012 London Games erupting for the home-grown stars like Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis as well as the charismatic Usain Bolt.On the final night of the track programme Bolt and Farah having just won gold medals paraded for the appreciative crowd that will surely be as generous for reigning Olympic and world 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk.Caster Semenya is the sole survivor of the SA track team from five years ago with Sunette Viljoen injured Anaso Jobodwana unable to qualify and Cornel Fredericks and LJ van Zyl not being picked despite achieving the criteria.Marathon runner Lusapho April is also back but the course never took him through this venue.Stephen Mokoka who also did the 42km in 2012 will experience this track for the first time in the 10 000m with Farah on Friday night.He ll be in action alongside sprinter Akani Simbine in the 100m heats and Semenya who s trying her hand at the 1500m at this level for the first time.For most of the SA team they are yet to experience their first dose of goosebumps in this arena which holds much promise for South Africa.SA has won nine world championship gold medals in the past 20 years including the retrospective upgrade for Semenya s 800m silver behind Russian doper Mariya Savinova.The class of 2017 could win four or five golds on their own.Van Niekerk added the 200m to his roster as he bids to become only the second man to win the 200m-400m double since American legend Michael Johnson in 1995.Semenya is going for the 800m-1500m double with most onlookers suspecting she won t beat the world s best at the longer distance.But she s not somebody you write off.Long-jumper Luvo Manyonga owns the four best jumps in the world this year from 8.61m to 8.65m.He hasn t competed since injuring his ankle in Stockholm in mid-June. If he s not fully recovered or a little rusty then there s Ruswahl Samaai the world s No2 ranked jumper.Samaai s 8.49m personal best is 15cm further than the top-ranked foreigner Tyrone Smith of Bermuda.And then there s Simbine who ended fifth in the Olympic 100m final at the Rio Games just three-hundredths of a second short of the podium.He s also doing a double competing against Van Niekerk and Clarence Munyai in the 200m.That s probably the sum total of the country s realistic medal hopes and if they all shine at full luminance London will become South Africa s richest off-shore gold mine. - TimesLIVE
