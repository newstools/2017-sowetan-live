While a major uproar erupted after it was revealed that Kaizer Chiefs were paying their goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma a pauper's wage, a handful of handsomely paid players in the PSL will need to do more to justify their fat cheques in the new season.The pay disparity in the domestic league sees some like Bvuma - whose contract confirming a R5000 monthly salary was exposed by Sowetan - earn a few thousand, while others are believed to be raking in up to R300 000 monthly.Football agent Tim Sukazi said high pay means nothing if the player cannot back it up."Players will have to deliver according to what the team paid for them in transfer and salary. Usually, if they under-perform, they will take a major pay cut at their new club," Sukazi told Sowetan, though reluctant to reveal figures.Though PSL players' salaries remain largely undisclosed, the R300 000 tag has been the most common speculated figure.Some of the big-money players who need to prove their worth.Tefu Mashamaite - SuperSport made a swoop for the defender after spending a year in Sweden.The 32-year-old's first season at Matsatsantsa was hampered by a knee injury. He make a handful of appearance in the second half of the season.Sibusiso Vilakazi - Sundowns were reported to have splashed R10-million to capture Vila from Wits last year.The midfielder struggled to make an impact in the face of a highly competitive Downs squad.Jabulani Shongwe - Wits signed Shongwe from Sundowns in 2014 but the midfielder fell down the pecking order.Thabo Qalinge - At the time of his move to Pirates from Black Aces, Qalinge was hot property, with Chiefs among the clubs chasing him in 2014. He is yet to live up to his potential despite his rumoured transfer of about R2-million.Siyanda Xulu - Xulu, 25, failed to convince Chiefs that he was worthy of a place in the starting XI in his two seasons at the club and his hefty salary apparently scared suitors. He joined Maritzburg United last week.
