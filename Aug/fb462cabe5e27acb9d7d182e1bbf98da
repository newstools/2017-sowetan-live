Even though he is disappointed to leave Free State after only two games in charge, Sammy Troughton does not hide that he was frustrated at the Bethlehem-based club because of the squad he had.Yesterday, Stars announced that they have terminated Troughton's contract and the former Polokwane City coach Luc Eymael replaced him."I was also not totally happy in Free State because I saw that we [he and the club's management] did not have enough in common."I am disappointed because I had a plan for this team," he said.Free State Stars sack Sammy Troughton and hire Belgian coach Luc Eymael"We needed additions to the squad. There were players who were promoted from the Motsepe League and I think they were thrown in the deep end. I am not against the youngsters but they have to be extraordinary to make the cut."There were seven or eight players who are over 30 years of age. I was frustrated at that situation," added the 53-year-old mentor.The former Stellenbosch coach believes Ea Lla Koto were going to be one of the best teams in the league, had he been given enough time."When you look at our game against Wits [a 2-2 draw on Wednesday] you see that something special was brewing," he said.Eymael's first match in charge of Stars will be against Sundowns on September 13.
