After a disjointed performance from his strikers, SuperSport United coach Eric Tinkler conceded the challenge going forward is to sharpen their edge in front of goal.Despite having no shortage of quality strikers, Matsatsantsa were unable to get the job done against Mamelodi Sundowns, who on the other hand played with a makeshift strike force of Percy Tau and Khama Billiat.Sundowns got the better of their neighbours for a seventh consecutive Absa Premiership match following their 2-0 win courtesy of goals from Hlompho Kekana and Themba Zwane at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday.SuperSport strikers Jeremy Brockie, Bradley Grobler and Thabo Mnyamane had a disappointing game and will have to improve in time for their clash against Kaizer Chiefs on Wednesday.Tinkler would have liked to get the season off to a better start, but will have a shot at redemption at the FNB Stadium against Amakhosi.With all the uncertainty surrounding his future, Brockie had a poor showing and was replaced in the second half after captain Dean Furman received a red card.It is unclear whether Brockie had his mind distracted by the negotiations happening behind the scenes, with Sundowns not relenting in their chase of his signature."We possibly brought Thabo back into this game slightly too early. He was out with an injury and I think he struggled with the tempo and pace of the game," said Tinkler."Maybe that's an error that I made in terms of my judgment, but we know his qualities and what he's capable of. If he gains anything it is match fitness and moving forward he can only get better."Tinkler said the minimum aim for Matsatsantsa this season would be to at least secure one cup.In other PSL matches played on Saturday, Ajax and Arrows played to a 1-1 draw; Pirates 1, Chippa 0; Polokwane 0, Baroka 0; AmaZulu 1, FS Stars 0; and Wits lost to by a goal to Cape Town City.
