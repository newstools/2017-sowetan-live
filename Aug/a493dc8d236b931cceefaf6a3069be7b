Is Wayde van Niekerk really struggling to hold his lead coming off the bend?Don't believe a word of it.The 2017 edition of Van Niekerk is no longer the same sprinter who won the world title two years ago or even the one who took Olympic crown.Already the influence of Usain Bolt is patently clear on SA's top athlete at the world championships in London.In the first two rounds of the 400m on Sunday, Van Niekerk emulated the dethroned Jamaican superstar by eye-balling his rivals on the home straight. That's a ploy Bolt has used many times during his illustrious career.It's normally worked.But what has been more curious is Van Niekerk's race strategy in his last three outings - in every case he has come off the bend in second place. That's unusual for the SA rocket, the 43.03sec world record holder as well as Olympic and world crowns.Three times he's hauled in rivals in front of him and then still looked around and eased off over the final few metres."The final is what counts so that's where I want to come first out of the bend," said Van Niekerk.Meanwhile, Van Niekerk advanced past the 200m heats last night, reaching the halfway mark of his double attempt. Akani Simbine also went through, but Clarence Munyai was disqualified for a lane violation. Wenda Nel (400m hurdles heats) also qualified for semis.For Van Niekerk, it's three races down and three to go.
