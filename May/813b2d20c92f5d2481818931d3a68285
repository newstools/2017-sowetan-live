The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein on Wednesday formalised an agreement setting aside the refugee status of former Rwandan army general Faustin Nyamwasa.The parties to the agreement were the Consortium of Refugees and Migrants in South Africa (CormSA) and several government respondents including the Minister of International Affairs Nyamwasa was granted asylum in 2010 after fleeing his home country due to a disagreement with Rwandan President Paul Kagame.Nyamwasa and Kagame were both founding members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) which took power in 1994 ending the mass slaughter of more than 800 000 Tutsi people. Nyamwasa has been accused of being involved in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity between 1994 and 1998 and was granted asylum despite the allegations sparking CORMSA the Southern Africa Litigation Centre (SALC) and the Wits Law Clinic to petition the courts. The SCA was set to hear the appeal by CormSA against a North Gauteng High Court Ruling that agreed with the State that Nyamwasa qualifies because he is a vulnerable person likely to face persecution if deported as stipulated in clause 3 of the Refugees Act which outweighs clause 4 of the Act which states no person is allowed asylum if he or she is believed to have been involved in war crimes or crimes against humanity.

He himself has through a deposition (affidavit) told French investigators that he heard Kagame say RPF forces were responsible for the assassination of former president Juvenual Habyarimana whose French-crewed plane was shot down with a missile on 1994.The State further maintained in court papers that according to the confidentiality of asylum applications it is not forced to divulge any details of why it decided to grant him refugee status details of which CormSA hoped would be made public through the courts.Habyarimana s death launched a campaign that targeted Rwanda s Tutsi people and over the next 100 days close to 800 000 people were slaughtered in cold blood.The first French probe in 2006 resulted in arrest warrants being issued for several people close to Kagame including Nyamwasa who responded by cutting diplomatic ties with France.CormSA has maintained in court papers that Nyamwasa s refugee status should be declared invalid arguing that the investigations by foreign authorities were competent and with merit citing extradition requests by those governments which were flatly refused by South Africa on Constitutional grounds.South Africa s Constitution states that no asylum seeker may be deported back to his or her home country if they are likely to face unfair persecution or harm.The Spanish have since dropped their indictment but vowed that if Nyamwasa was to set foot on its territory he would be arrested and charged in connection with the killings of Spanish nuns.No arguments were presented the SALC said in a statement on Thursday revealing that the decision to grant Nyamwasa refugee status was reviewed and set aside. The order is suspended for a period of 180 days from the date of appeal to enable the Department of Home Affairs refugee authorities to reconsider and make a final decision on the refugee status of the respondent [Nyamwasa] the statement read.Nyamwasa would be permitted to make written and oral submissions to the authorities to argue his case.
