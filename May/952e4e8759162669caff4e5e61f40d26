The man who benefited the most from Appletiser's black economic empowerment deal struck this week, started off as a cleaner at Coca-Cola Beverages SA 28 years ago.CCBSA announced that it had sold 17.5% of its shareholding in Appletiser South Africa (ASA) to a black owned investment company, African Pioneer Group (APG), and an additional 4% stake was sold to Sipho Excellent Madlala, as a black empowerment partner.Appletiser was previously wholly owned by SABMiller but as part of the AB InBev merger conditions it became a subsidiary of CCBSA.The deal will see Madlala representing the empowerment company as a board director.In 1999, a year after Madlala matriculated from Sigweje High School in Wasbank, Kwazulu-Natal, he came across a group of people standing outside Suncrush/ABI's offices in Ladysmith and was told that the company was hiring.He bypassed the group, went straight to the reception area and was referred to a waiting room in which short-listed job candidates were seated and filling forms.He passed his interview and he was hired as a cleaner on a six months contract."It was hard work but I did it all, including learning how to operate all machines, and filling in when other colleagues were not at work. I did everything without complaining, so when the six months review period was up, my contract was extended and in 1991 I was appointed on a permanent basis as a machine operator, he said.Madlala later applied for a merchandising job in the sales department despite the role being two grades below his pay. Within six months I was appointed to sales rep and excelled both in sales targets and marketing standards. I was later appointed to key accounts rep and at this time, I was only calling on top end grocers. His work there then earned him a promotion to account manager.He continued to work his way up ladder, eventually earning the executive position of District Manager for [then ABI and now CCBSA].The married father of seven said his time at the company was not always smooth sailing. I had to keep my head down and soldier on to make my sales targets. Perseverance, hard work and resilience have governed my game over the years. I also encourage young colleagues entering the business to set high standards and strive to achieve them, rather than trying to be better than the person next to them, he said.sibanyonim@sowetan.co.za
