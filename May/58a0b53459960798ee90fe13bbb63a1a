Victory for Baroka FC away against Stellenbosch FC in the opening game of the Premier Soccer League s promotion-relegation play-offs on Wednesday afternoon (kick off 3pm) could render the rest of the mini- competition a formality said coach Milton Dlamini on the eve of the game at the Athlone Stadium in Cape Town. We are going into the game preparing for a win because this is our only away game in these play-offs " he said."The game against Black Leopards we take it as a home game because they are only 100km away from us. If we start well against Stellenbosch then we ll be home and dry because we have two home games in four days."So we feel it s vital for us to get something out of this game because we won t have another away game again. Baroka remained in Cape Town after Saturday s heroics where their 1-0 win over Ajax Cape Town lifted them off the bottom of the PSL standings and saw them finish second last thereby sending them into the play-offs against Black Leopards and Stellenbosch.But they will have to play without hero Letladi Madubanya who scored the goal that won the match but was then sent off. There is not much we can do about the situation added Dlamini whose previous stint as coach of Mbombela United leaves him well versed with Stellenbosch s style. I know Steve Barker s style from AmaZulu and he always brings Mame Niang with him!"There will be a lot of hustling and bustling at the back for that first ball."With all due respect we know them but that doesn t mean they can t beat us."They can if they use their chances but we are going to use our strength to take the game to them."We are definitely not going to defend. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
