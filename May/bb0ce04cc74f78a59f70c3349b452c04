Cape Town - South Africa s bowlers and fielders have plenty of homework to do before their Champions Trophy examination.That was clear from their performance in the first one-day international against England at Headingley in Leeds on Wednesday. Amajita have their backs to the wall AB de Villiers won the toss and chose to field, and his attack repaid that apparent confidence by conceding a total of 339/6 - the highest score posted in the 39 ODIs played at the ground. Only Chris Morris, aside from part-time JP Duminy, looked the part in a bowling unit that bled runs and had to rely on loose strokes for their wickets.Morris took 2/61 and bowled the only maiden of the innings. Duminy went wicketless, but the 34 runs he gave up off six overs made him South Africa s tidiest bowler.
