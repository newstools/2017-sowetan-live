Just for this week Willard Katsande will be an Orlando Pirates fan as two huge games for Kaizer Chiefs archrivals stand to rescue Amakhosi s league title race.Pirates meet Absa Premiership leaders Bidvest Wits at Bidvest Stadium on Thursday night then second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns at Orlando Stadium on Sunday.For fourth-placed Chiefs who have slipped in the title race two wins for the Buccaneers would come as manna from heaven opening up the championship race again.Amakhosi s last-gasp goals they conceded in their last two games saw them lose 3-2 away against Cape Town City and draw 2-2 in Nelspruit against SuperSport United.Chiefs are on 46 points from 26 games six points behind Wits and five behind Sundowns who both have a game in hand.Katsande though is not giving up on the title race saying simply: This league is unpredictable . Chiefs though are largely pinning their hopes on a good week for Pirates. Pirates somewhere somehow are playing a huge part in where the league is going Katsande said. Obviously it s going to be two massive games for them. And obviously they need to do well so that they stay in the top eight and qualify for the MTN8 next season. So obviously they are not going to take anything for granted. And also one of the matches they play at home. And also they play Wits in Johannesburg where they have a huge following. So they will be pumped up. And also they do have a new coach (Kjell Jonevret) and the players have been eager to impress. So obviously there s something that they are going to play for. And we re hoping for them to grind the results in these two games. And then it will be game on and for us to win our own games. Chiefs meet Lamontville Golden Arrows at FNB Stadium on Saturday night. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
