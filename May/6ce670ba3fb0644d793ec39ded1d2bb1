Stanley Menzo says his Ajax Cape Town side is returning to their best form as he looks for a strong finish to the season in their push for a place in the top eight.Ajax are away at Chippa United on Saturday where a victory would likely make absolutely sure of their stay in the Absa Premiership next season.That already looks near certain with 29 points gained so far the latest coming in a 2-0 victory over Platinum Stars on Sunday that was more one-sided than the scoreline suggests.Menzo believes that performance was similar to their displays at the end of 2016 when they won five out of six league games to propel themselves out of the relegation zone. There was pressure on us I wanted the team to return to what we showed late last year. For me I had to find that key Menzo admitted. In the back of my head I'm thinking we can qualify for the top eight but we are not quite safe yet so let's settle that first before we think of these things. Ajax have been notoriously poor travellers for a number of seasons and with just two league wins in 13 matches on the road this campaign will go in Saturday s clash as under-dogs even if Chippa are in deeper relegation trouble.Menzo suggests a point will be a more than satisfactory result for his side. Away from home it s always difficult but if we can win our remaining home games and get a results away that will help us finish in a good position. The Dutch coach does have a number of injury and suspension concerns including one of his stalwart players from this season.Mosa Lebusa is suspended for the game [Brett] Evans Tassie [Tashreeq Morris] and Tokkie [Toriq Losper] still miss out though injury while Abel [Mabaso] is ill. Ajax have never managed an away win at Chippa either when the latter was based in Cape Town or since their relocation to Port Elizabeth.They did win the reverse fixture at home earlier this season 1-0 thanks to a late goal from Prince Nxumalo. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
