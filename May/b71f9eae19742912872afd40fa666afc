Impeccably dressed as usual and wearing the same silver aeroplane motif on his lapel Henri van Breda on Thursday seemed more engaged than before in the legal process that could lead to him spending life behind bars.He is accused of murdering his mother father and brother and the attempted murder of his sister at the family s luxury home at the De Zalze estate in Stellenbosch in 2015.The sixth day of the trial began with the softly-spoken Susan Galloway representing the state questioning David Wyngaard who sat calmly in the witness stand.As on Wednesday the technical details of the De Zalze estate s security system were scrutinised in minute detail.Wyngaard a security guard said: I would have driven past that house between six and seven times during my shift ... there is a main road that goes past the cul de sac there. He also said: We go and look if any garage doors are open ... we drive through the estate between the houses. If we see a garage door is open we contact the owners. Galloway asked if it was correct that residents who live on the estate know that in the case of an emergency they can call security. Wyngaard responded: Yes. The number is on the vehicle. Unlike the two previous witnesses Wyngaard tended to mumble and speak fast infuriating defence counsel Piet Botha and Matthys Combrink who repeatedly complained to Judge Siraj Desai that they could not hear him.
