South Africa s major telecoms companies have been asked to reveal how many times they were forced to share sensitive customer call records.Advocacy group Right2know has lodged requests for surveillance statistics from MTN Vodacom Telkom and Cell C under the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA). Recently the Daily Maverick reported on a legal loophole that allows magistrates to authorise thousands of surveillance operations every year said R2K in a statement on Tuesday.This allowed the handing over of customer call records and metadata to happen in parallel to the country s official surveillance law. The usual procedure for a law enforcement agency to legally intercept this type of information involved getting permission from a specially appointed judge.

That person is never notified even if the investigation is dropped or if they are found to be innocent. A person s call records contains incredibly sensitive information and needs high levels of protection to enforce the constitutional right to privacy said R2K.The application was made to get desperately needed transparency in the use of state surveillance in South Africa and the role of the private sector.
