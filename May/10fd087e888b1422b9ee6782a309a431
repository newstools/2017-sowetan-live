Tembo was pleased with the victory, but not happy that they conceded three goals."[I'm] not happy with the three goals conceded, but I am happy with overall performance of the team. We always score goals."If we play our normal football, we always create chances. We are playing many competitions, but we always try to take it a game at a time."We played the [Nedbank] semifinal and came here [to Gabon] and did well," said Tembo, who gave an opportunity to players such as Kekana, Keegan Ritchie and Fagrie Lakay."We rested some players, and the ones who played were fresher and they did well. We don't choose tournaments. We try to put a strong team in every game we play."Both United and Dikwena must now switch focus to the domestic front this weekend, when the face each other at Lucas Moripe Stadium in their final Absa Premiership fixture.
