Shops, schools and businesses were shut in southeast Nigeria yesterday, 50 years to the day since an independent republic of Biafra was declared, sparking a brutal civil war.In Onitsha, the economic hub of Anambra state on the banks of the River Niger, most markets were closed and the streets were largely empty.Separatist sentiment persists in the region, which is dominated by the Igbo people, and the main pro-Biafran independence group has called on supporters to stay at home."No work today, we are Biafran, we are not Nigerians," said Ebere Ichukwu Eli, one of the few people to venture outside, where there was a visible security presence. "No violence, it is a peaceful sit at home. We are protesting peacefully," the 47-year-old told AFP.A woman who gave her name only as Justine said: "We want our one Biafra. It's our land. That's why we all sit at home today."Nigerian police last week denounced "planned protests and order of market closures" and warned it would "deal decisively" with any breach of the peace or unlawful protest.Last year, demonstrations marking the declaration of Biafran independence turned bloody. Amnesty International said the military gunned down more than 60 people.
