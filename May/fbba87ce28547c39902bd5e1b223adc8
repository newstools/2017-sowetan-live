Platinum Stars coach Cavin Johnson will not take Swazi opponents Mbabane Swallows lightly when they lock horns in the CAF Confederation Cup group phase today (3pm).This is the first time Swallows have reached the group stage of a continental club competition, beating Orapa United (Botswana), Azam (Tanzania) and AC Leopards (Congo) on their way to qualify for the round robin phase of the tournament.It's clear that Umkhonto Kashaka - as Swallows are affectionately known - have improved on the continent. So Dikwena should not think they will walk all over the six-time Swazi Premier League champions just because they are from a country where football is not as developed as it is in South Africa.Stars need to bounce back after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Algerian outfit MC Alger in their opening Group B tie just over a week ago. Teenager Katlego Khunou rescued a point for Dikwena at Royal Bafokeng Stadium.They'll face Swallows on astro turf at Somhlolo National Stadium this afternoon."We will go with the strongest team we can in order to get three points. We trained on astro turf," said coach Johnson. "We have quite a bit [of information], like we had on Alger. Some of their games are on TV, so we were able to get it."SuperSport United are also involved in Confederation Cup action today (4pm), against Gabonese outfit CF Mounana at Stade de Franceville.Matsatsantsa travelled without coach Stuart Baxter, who will announce his first Bafana Bafana squad on Thursday.This gives assistant coach Kaitano Tembo a chance to prove himself in the position.The former Zimbabwean international defender recently did a sterling job relaying instructions from the bench while Baxter was in hospital.
