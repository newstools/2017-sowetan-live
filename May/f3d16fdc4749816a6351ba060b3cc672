Government has made a commitment to provide scholar transport for all children attending cross-border schools between Mpumalanga and Gauteng.This in the wake of a tragic accident that claimed the lives of 18 pupils and two adults along the R25 road between Bronkhorstspruit in Gauteng and Verena in Mpumalanga on April 21.Gauteng MEC for education Panyaza Lesufi told hundreds of mourners gathered at Sokhulumi Community Hall in Sokhulumi village, outside Bronkhorstspruit, that this would be done in honour of the victims who perished in a taxi accident."[Government] will enter into a discussion to ensure that children from Mpumalanga that are coming to Gauteng and children from Gauteng that [travel] to Mpumalamga will have scholar transport," said Lesufi to applause."We have spoken to the national minister [Angie Motshekga] and she has given us a go-ahead. When we visited the families of the deceased, the level of poverty and unemployment ... was at a high level."But they took their last cent to give their children education to defeat poverty."Lesufi said two tombstones would be unveiled in April, at Refano Primary and Mahlenga Secondary. The two schools are located in Sokhulumi, a village within Gauteng borders. Together they lost 18 pupils in the tragedy.Sixteen pupils and the general assistant will be buried in Wolvenkop village in Verena on Saturday, while two other pupils will be buried on Sunday in KZN and Limpopo.A public memorial service will be held at the Verena open ground today.Meanwhile, 13 pupils from Kamagugu Inclusive School were slightly injured after a taxi they were travelling in overturned along Kamagugu road in Mbombela, Mpumalanga yesterday.Department of community safety, security and liaison spokesman Joseph Mabuza said: "The back tyre of the taxi came off, the taxi [then] lost control and overturned.The learners were taken to Rob Ferreira Hospital."
