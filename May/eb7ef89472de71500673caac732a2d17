A secret message? Or just a typo?Wags around the world weighed in with biting sarcasm, and #covfefe quickly became the top trending item on Twitter.Comments included a mock Google translation of "covfefe" from Russian into English as "I resign," and comments like "Drain the covfefe" -- a play on Trump's promise to "drain the swamp" in Washington."'Covfefe is a great word, period! - Sean Spicer tomorrow," read one tweet, mentioning the president's spokesman.To avoid confusion, the Regent's English Language Center in London wrote: "To all of our English language students, we can confirm that 'covfefe' is not an English word. Yet."Four hours later the tweet had been neither corrected nor deleted, nor was there any hint of what Trump was trying to say.At 0830 GMT Trump's "covfefe" tweet had more than 105,000 retweets and had been shared 35,000 times, according to Twitter figures.Since entering office, Trump has used Twitter to issue declarations on everything from Arnold Schwarzenegger's TV performance to an alleged "MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany."
