President Jacob Zuma and the aged Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe are dictators, they must go.The call was made by Heritage Maravanyana, the information secretary of the Zimbabwe-based National People's Party.He launched the attack on Zuma and Mugabe while addressing nearly 1000 people gathered at Joubert Park in Johannesburg, during the EFF rally to mark Africa Day."All dictators must go," Maravanyana said.The surprise attack comes after Zuma had previously said if he was a dictator for six months, he would solve all South Africa's problems.Maravanyana sang the praises of EFF leader Julius Malema, saying he was the only opposition party leader who stood publicly to denounce Mugabe."We need more Malemas who are going to say 'Zuma must go'."In his speech, Malema called for African unity, saying it was the only way to defeat capitalism and (neo)colonialism.Although Malema said Mugabe has overstayed his position in power, he praised Mugabe's controversial land reform programme.Malema called on whites to behave because they are visitors."We will make the visit of whites [to Africa] pleasurable if they don't misbehave."He told the crowd that Africans should unite around the land and economic questions. "Those who want to divide Africans must not do so in our name.""We must isolate those who call people 'makwerekwere', because without unity, we will never defeat [neo]colonialism.""How do you love whites and yet hate Africans?" he said.He said Africans were poor because they were not united.The EFF leader said he agreed that South African men were trash. "If we don't want to be called that, let us change our conduct. Let us take responsibility and stop blaming others."He said the killing of Karabo Mokoena, who was allegedly killed by her boyfriend, was a wake-up call.Malema stunned people when he called on men to "kidnap" politicians and not young girls.He added that if it was up to him, the continent would be led by women."Women don't use power to fight personal battles," Malema said.
