Bongeka Phungula's daughter still thinks that her mother is coming back and refuses to accept that she is dead.The 28-year-old Phungula's body was found in Tladi, Soweto, on Saturday while that of her friend Popi Qwabe was discovered on Friday in Naledi. Phungula's aunt Phumzile Mkhize told Sowetan yesterday that Phungula's 13-year-old daughter Minenhle was not coping with the death of her mother."She has been saying that her mother is alive and [that] she told her that she is coming back. She does not believe that her mother is dead and it's just so sad to watch," said Mkhize.Minenhle, who is in Grade 8, was, according to Mkhize, chatting on WhatsApp with her mother on Friday and that is why it is difficult for her to believe that she is gone.Phungula was also 13 when her own mother died. She had been living with her grandmother since then.Mkhize said the first person who suspected that something was wrong was Phungula's boyfriend, who lives in Durban. He could not reach her on the phone on Friday evening."He told us that they never went to bed without talking to each other but on Friday, from 7.30pm, he called and she did not respond; he later sent her a message. He said he called her again on Saturday at 5am but still she was not answering her phone," said Mkhize.Mkhize said he then went on Facebook, where Qwabe's cousin said he too could not get hold of the pair.On Monday, according to Mkhize, Qwabe's cousin went to the police station and that is where he learnt the pair had been found dead."It is hard for us as the family to accept that she is dead. Her grandmother is not taking the news well," Mkhize said, adding the family had no money to bury Phungula. She said no one was working in the family and Phungula, who arrived in Johannesburg from Durban in February, was the breadwinner even though she had been unemployed for about a yearColonel Lungelo Dlamini said three people were arrested for the two murders.
