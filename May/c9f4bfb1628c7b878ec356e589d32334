The Gauteng education department on Monday accused Parktown Boys High officials of failing to report to them allegations that a staff member was suspected of sexually abusing 20 pupils. The matter was not formally reported to the department by the school. Rather the department became aware only after the issue became public said department spokesperson Oupa Bodibe. The failure by the school to report these serious allegations smack of an attempt to sweep them under the carpet Bodibe added.But the chairperson of the school governing body (SGB) Nicholas Greyling said the department had been informed. I m not sure why the information wasn t escalated up to him (education MEC Panyaza Lesufi) because we definitely informed our district office the following day of that and we were even visited (by the district) and a representative from the department. How it was not escalated to the MEC I m not sure Greyling told 702.According to his Facebook profile the 21-year-old water polo instructor accused of the crime was once a pupil at the affluent school.He appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court on March 1 when the case was postponed to gather statements from the alleged victims.The accused who isn t being named until he has pleaded was granted R3 000 bail in November 2016.At the time of his last appearance only nine learners had come forward with the damning allegations.The young man s alleged crimes were reported to have been captured on a CCTV camera leading to his removal from the school.However the education department said it would launch its own investigation into the allegations. Any educator found guilty of this nature of misconduct should be dismissed as they betray the duty to protect children under their care Bodibe said.Department officials were expected to visit the school this morning.
