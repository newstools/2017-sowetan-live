Veteran Letladi Madubanya proved the saviour for Baroka FC as they finished the season with an all-important 1-0 away win over Ajax Cape Town which lifted them off bottom place in the Absa Premiership matches and into the promotion-relegation play-offs, starting on Wednesday with an away game at Stellenbosch FC.A former league winner with SuperSport United, the 33-year-old veteran powered home a header from a corner in the 51st minute to hand Baroka s their escape from an immediate return back down to the National First Division.But their battle against the drop is not over yet as they now face Stellenbosch and Limpopo rivals Black Leopards in the play-offs over the next three weeks to decide one place in the top flight in the next campaign.Highlands Park go down after drawing 2-2 with Mamelodi Sundowns in Tembisa while a goalless draw in Bethlehem between Free State Stars and Chippa saw them finish directly abovee Baroka but on goal difference only. We set out to win this game, we ve been waiting for a long time for a victory. Hopefully we can survive and next season get a better Baroka on the field, said co-coach Milton Dlamini after the final whistle as his relieved players celebrated with a small band of traveling fans.Defeat for Ajax ended their hopes of a top eight place as Lamontville Golden Arrows, with a 2-1 win over Orlando Pirates, knocked them down to 10th.Ajax were effectively outmuscled and down to 10 men just before half-time ; although Madubanya got a second yellow just nine minutes after his goalz to even the imbalance.There were no clear first half chances on a sunny afternoon in the Cape but more commitment from Baroka whose physical approach seem to strike fear into the home team.Ironically, however, it was a clumsy lunge from Roscoe Pietersen that saw Ajax reduced to 10 men five minutes before half-time. He caught Letladi Madubanya late and brought him to ground when the veteran looked to be through on goal.Referee Kulsande Qonqo ruled it a professional foul and sent Pietersen for an early shower, forcing Ajax to sacrifice Bantu Mzwakali in attack so that they could bring in Eric Chipeta as a substitute to shore up the defence.Baroka did bang in several crosses but just one presented an opportunity, with Victor Letsoalo missing out. Baroka let themselves down in the build-up with a characteristically wild and wooly approach.Madubanya s goal came from Nkosinathi Ndlovu s corner as he outjumped his teammate Nyasha Munetsi to power home a kick. His signing on a free transfer in March now proves the best business Baroka did all season.Maboke Matlakala could have doubled the lead soon after before Madubanya then picked up two yellow in quick session and went to join Pieterse on the sidelines.Once the numbers on the field were even Ajax woke up and Prince Nxumalo aw his 80th minute effort cleared off the line.But they could not find a way through in a desperate late surge and Matlakala might have made it 2-0- with the last kick of the game but instead conjured up arguably the worst miss of the season. Not that Baroka minded too much. They live to fight another day. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
