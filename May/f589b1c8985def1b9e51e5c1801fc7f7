The SACP is embarking on a fresh attempt to ensure that President Jacob Zuma is removed from office.The latest attempt comes after the SACP and trade union federation Cosatu took a decision that Zuma must step down.Speaking on the sidelines of the National Union of Mineworkers' education and training summit in Midrand, northern Johannesburg, yesterday, SACP second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila said Zuma has to leave and there was no doubt about it."We will roll out our own programme until the ANC can listen to the masses of our country that they don't want this president to lead them," he said.Mapaila accused Zuma of gross misconduct and violating the ANC consultation policy when he announced his recent cabinet reshuffle."The Guptas have a say in the appointment of the cabinet and that is gross misconduct."Our own organisation is being swallowed by the vitriol and the venom of the Guptas. The Guptas have got proxy on leaders in our movement who act directly in their interests."Mapaila also said Zuma, a close friend of the Guptas, was controlled by a particular faction in the ANC."This is the most excruciating feeling you can ever get as a member when your leader cannot be above factions."Mapaila said the SACP, which played a vital role in orchestrating Zuma's rise to power, has been talking to Zuma and other ANC leaders to deal with the "Premier League" which allegedly "stole" the ANC Women's League (ANCWL) and ANC Youth League conferences with money.The "Premier League" is said to be led by Zuma's allies North West premier Supra Mahumapelo, Free State premier Ace Magashule and Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza."At the ANCWL conference there were people who arrived there with lots of money in the boot of their cars," Mapaila said. "The security was aware about it. This matter was reported. We asked for an investigation. They can't investigate it because the source will point to leaders. That is how you destroy an organisation."
