About 100 African migrants stormed over a high double fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla yesterday in a violent assault that left three police officers injured, officials said.Around 300 sub-Saharan African migrants attempted to force their way across the fence at about 7am in a coordinated operation, a Spanish police spokesman said."Around 100 managed to enter Melilla," he said.The barrier is composed of two six-metre-high fences, with crisscrossing steel cables in between. In order to get across, migrants often use hooks and shoes studded with nails.Three policemen were injured in clashes with the migrants, who kicked and threw rocks at the officers, Spain's interior ministry said in a statement.One of the officers was injured in the hand by one of the hooks used by migrants and several police vehicles were damaged, it added.Three migrants suffered bruises and small cuts in the attempt to cross the border, said a Red Cross spokesman.Melilla and Ceuta, another Spanish enclave nearly 400 kilometres away on the north coast of Africa, are often used as entry points into Europe for African migrants.They have the only two land borders between Africa and the European Union.
