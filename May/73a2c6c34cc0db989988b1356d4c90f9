South African Schools Football Association (Sasfa) president Mandla Shoes Mazibuko says they are willing to find middle ground and work with the South African Football Association (Safa).The two organisations have a long-running frosty relationship and new Sports Minister Thembelani Thulas Nxesi issued a directive to Safa this week instructing the football mother body to find a way to work with Sasfa as per an order issued by the courts last year.The two organisations have been in a turf way following a decision by Safa to endorse a resolution to dissolve Sasfa last year which ended up in court that ordered them to find each other. Professional sport is well-resourced amateur clubs and local football associations are doing well and yet findings of the EPG Transformation Status Report indicate that your presence in the schools is wanting " Nxesi."My predecessor (Fikile Mbalula) issued a directive for Safa to take over control of the Sasfa with a view to greatly expand the presence of football in schools and align competition structures and age-grades across the system. As we know this ended in court with the court issuing an interim judgment calling upon the two bodies to endeavour to find each other."My department has not been informed of any progress in implementing the judgment."I am therefore directing Safa to initiate the process of implementing the judgment forthwith and if third party mediation is required my department remains ready to provide assistance. Mazibuko said they have not received correspondence from Safa in regards to finding ways of working with Safa but they are willing to work with the mother body in upholding the court order. What pleases us is that there was a directive from the minister of sport and we welcome it. The court judgment was clear and we are happy to work with Safa to uphold it."We did not go away from Safa but we were chased away and they are the ones who appealed the court decision that we must find ways to work together."If the minister s directive is not followed we will wait for August 7 which is the date that has been set for Safa s appeal said Mazibuko on Wednesday.Safa chief executive Dennis Mumble was not available for comment. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
