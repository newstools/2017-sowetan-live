House DJ Prince Kaybee says he has fully recovered following a surgery to reduce his man boobs earlier this year.Kaybee, whose real name is Kabelo Motsamai, said that his breast surgery journey - which he embarked on two years ago - is finally complete. "I am happy with my journey right now. Everything has healed perfectly. I am happy with everything and cannot wait to show off my new body," he giggled. Kaybee, who broke into the music scene in 2015 with his hit track Wajelwa, said he struggled with large male boobs even when he was in puberty.The medical condition is called gynecomastia. He said he tried to get rid of the boobs by going to gym and eating healthily, but they would not go away until he decided to do the costly surgery."It is not cheap. Some people choose to go to public hospitals to do it but it takes forever as there are too may people on the queue. I went to a private hospital, which costs about R45000 for the complete surgery."I think it is the best thing I have done for myself. I have such an improved confidence level and I can say I am complete now. I am happy," he said.Kaybee said he wanted to work with international superstar Rihanna on his next single. "Not that I am trying to be like Black Coffee or anything, but it's a life-long dream of mine. I have my people in the USA who are trying to get her signature ... but I won't lie to you, it is not easy at all."He said his new single titled Charlotte is doing much better than his last single. "I think this next album is my best work so far. I have outdone myself."
