Pitso Mosimane has been in quite a few league title battles in his time, so don't expect him to press the panic button when he suffers one defeat.Edged 1-0 by title rivals Bidvest Wits on Monday, the Mamelodi Sundowns coach did not show any signs of concern despite losing the top spot.Sundowns have Platinum Stars (tomorrow), Orlando Pirates, Baroka, Maritzburg United and Highlands Park left on their fixture schedule.Wits, meanwhile, still have to face Pirates (tomorrow), Maritzburg, Free State Stars, Polokwane City and Kaizer Chiefs. Chances are that the race will go to the final day of the season and Cape Town City certainly cannot be left out of it."There's pressure on everybody. It was in Cape Town City's hands, then it was in our hands and now it's in Wits' hands," said Mosimane."We have to try to win against Platinum Stars and keep going. Football is not about who has the easier run. Maybe it will go to the end. I've got Highlands Park and they've got Chiefs. So we'll see, don't get emotional."The defeat at Wits brought Sundowns' run of five straight wins to a halt. They were nowhere near their best, but Mosimane did not put any blame on his players."I budget to lose this one every year. To be honest, Wits wanted it more than us in the first half. They fought. In the second half at least we tried to play," said Mosimane.
