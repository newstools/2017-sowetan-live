Thousands of students at the University of Johannesburg have been made beneficiaries of the institution s missing middle campaign which has raised R147-million since January.The university exceeded its target of R120-million for 2017 to support 4 000 students whose families earn too much for them to qualify for NSFAS loans but not enough to afford fees.The university raised the funds through several initiatives including an awareness campaign called Future Walk which raised R2-million.When the missing middle campaign launched in February 2016 it became the biggest fundraising campaign undertaken by a South African university. We have managed to exceed the target (of R120-million) through generous contributions from business and industry the public sector our suppliers and the UJ Future Walk said Professor Ihron Rensburg vice-chancellor and principal of UJ. We will continue these efforts during the remainder of 2017 to expand our support to academically deserving missing middle students who are in dire need of financial assistance. The campaign raised R101-million last year.
