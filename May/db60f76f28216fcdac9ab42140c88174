A number of South Africa s foreign legion are in contention for silverware this season as their various campaign s wind down in Europe.Striker Dino Ndlovu has already clinched the league title in Azerbaijan after an excellent first campaign there in which he has netted 15 goals in 27 starts.But he can now complete the Double if he can help his Qarabag side to victory in the country s FA Cup competition with that final to be played against Qabala on Saturday.The latter were runners-up in the league championship this season and these are the two best teams in the country so it is certainly not sure that Ndlovu will triumph.Qarabag did the Double last season and are looking to repeat that triumph in 2016/17.Bongani Zungu has enjoyed a remarkable six months at Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes and could cap that with a victory in the country s FA Cup when they play the final against giants Benfica on May 28.Vitoria last won the cup in 2012/13 their only previous major trophy in their 94-year history.May Mahlangu is in with a good shout at a league and cup Double in his first season in Romania.His Dinamo Bucharest side trail league leaders Viitorul and Steaua Bucharest by two points with two games remaining and they must play the former on the final day of the season.Mahlangu is also in the final of the country s League Cup against fourth from bottom Poli Timi oara on May 20 and will be favourites to lift the trophy.Lebogang Phiri s Brondby are in the semifinals of the Danish Cup and have a two-legged tie against Midtjylland starting on Thursday.Brondby have already beaten their opponents twice in the league this season and will likely face runaway league leaders FC Copenhagen in the final if they advance.Kermit Erasmus French Ligue 2 side Lens could yet be crowned champions of that division though it is a bit of a long shot as they trail leaders Strasbourg by four points with three games remaining.Keaghan Jacobs has already claimed the League One division title in Scotland with Livingston while Michael Travis could be crowned League Two champion with Forfar Athletic.They are a point behind leaders Arbroath with the final round of matches in the regular season to be played this weekend.Andile Jali missed out on silverware in Belgium in March when his Oostende side lost to Zulte-Waregem on penalties in the final of the country s FA Cup after a 3-3 draw.The Bafana Bafana midfielder was an unused substitute in the game. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
