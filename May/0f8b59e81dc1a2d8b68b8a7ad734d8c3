ANC presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma went on a charm offensive on Friday, reaching out to the masses she now needs in her quest for the top office.The usually reserved Dlamini-Zuma came out of her shell as her ANC Women's League parade marched through Stinkwater, near Hammanskraal north of Pretoria, to launch the Molo Makhelwane (Good day neighbour) programme, which aims to assist the government to get closer to the people.Emerging from a black Mercedes Benz, a relaxed-looking Dlamini-Zuma demonstrated her openness by shaking locals' hands and dancing to music from an ANC truck.Dlamini-Zuma, who has been endorsed by the ANCWL and the ANC Youth League to succeed President Jacob Zuma as the next ANC president, was accompanied by the women's league secretary-general Meokgo Matuba and Pastor Paseka (Mboro) Motsoeneng of Incredible Happenings Ministries.Her visit in Stinkwater could be interpreted as part of her campaign to be the next ANC president in December when the ANC holds its national elective conference.She visited two houses and Marotola Primary School, the oldest school in Stinkwater.Thipe Mahlare, a teacher at the school, told Sowetan they felt honoured to have been visited by Dlamini-Zuma .The jovial Dlamini-Zuma got agitated when journalists started bombarding her with questions.Asked if she was there to drum up support ahead of the ANC national elective conference, she replied: "We cannot stop assisting our people because there is an election, because we are scared you will say we're electioneering."Asked to comment on Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's public criticism of Zuma, she said: "We are here about Molo Makhelwane. We are not here about discussing ANC leaders."A house rebuilt by Motsoeneng for Johanna Rametsi (136), possibly SA's oldest citizen, was handed over to her .
