Ajax Cape Town can now start to think about winning a place in the top eight this season, which would be a remarkable end to a dismal campaign in which they flirted with relegation.This is the view of coach Stanley Menzo, who was delighted with the dominant display of his side in the 2-0 home win over Platinum Stars on Sunday.Goals from the excellent Grant Margeman and Ndiviwe Mdabuka sealed a comfortable win and leaves Ajax just three points behind Maritzburg United in seventh, though the latter have a game in hand."We can look a little bit up now rather than down," Menzo said, though he added he was cautious about being too over-confident."If we can win our next three games it will be great. It's a better situation than three or four weeks ago."Ajax are away at struggling Chippa United on Saturday, and also have home matches against relegation-threatened Bloemfontein Celtic and Baroka.Their other match is an away trip to Orlando Pirates on May 17. - TMG Digital
