A cash-strapped SABC has admitted in parliament it is not only facing a financial crisis, but also its flagship commercial television and radio stations are fast losing audiences.SABC acting CEO James Aguma said "internal dynamics" like negative news stories were also playing a major role.Aguma was presenting the SABC's corporate plan for the 2017/2018 financial year before the communications portfolio committee yesterday.He also acknowledged the 90% local content policy that was unilaterally implemented by former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng last year, had cost the public broadcaster dearly.The big losers, he added, were Metro FM, 5FM, Goodhope FM and SABC3.He said the main reasons for the underperformance in revenue could be attributed to key factors like a drop in advertising spend by both local and multinational clients."The 90/10 local music quotas ... had an impact of R29-million on radio and R183-million on television," said Aguma.The losses could climb further as the figures were still being revised.Febe Potgieter-Gqubule, an SABC interim board member, said they wanted Aguma and his team to present them with a strategy of how to reverse the losses.Parliament heard that staff morale was so low the place resembled a "military base" and was a hotbed of abuse.This was the assertion of most MPs. They recommended SABC staffers, in particular young women, were in need of counselling.Lawmakers also lashed out at Aguma, saying he should take personal responsibility and resign for his role in the financial crisis.The ANC's Nokuzola Tolashe told the committee a recent oversight visit to the SABC's Auckland Park offices showed a troubled organisation.DA MP Phumzile van Damme told Aguma it was "very strange" for him to continue with business as usual as if he had no role in the ruin.Chairwoman of the SABC interim board, Khanyisile Kweyama, said they wanted to swiftly fill the position of CEO and COO, adding that they wanted the Special Investigating Unit to probe promotions and salary increases.
