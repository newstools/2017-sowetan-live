Stuart Baxter is expected to be on the bench when SuperSport United host relegation threatened Bloemfontein Celtic at the Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville on Wednesday night.Baxter who has been strongly linked with the Bafana Bafana in recent months missed United s win over Bidvest Wits and draw against Kaizer Chiefs a few days ago after he was hospitalised last Monday for an emergency medical treatment.Before he was admitted to hospital United were on a three-match losing streak following back-to-back defeats to bitter Tshwane rivals Mamelodi Sundowns and relegation haunted Baroka FC.Longtime club assistant coach Kaitao Tembo was given the mammoth responsibility of guiding the team during Baxter s absence and he covered himself in glory with four points from a possible six after a hard fought win over Wits and a draw against Chiefs.The successive defeats at the hands of Baroka and Sundowns effectively extinguished United s chances of challenging for the league title and they now have to settle for finishing as high as possible.That mission continues against a desperate Celtic side who will arrive in the capital with all the points at stake foremost on their minds as only three seperate them from basement side Highlands Park. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
