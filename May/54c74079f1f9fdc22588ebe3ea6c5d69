Henri van Breda s behaviour when he called the emergency services was so atypical of a witness to murder that the responder on the other end of the line was convinced it was a prank call.Janine Philander who worked for the City of Cape Town s emergency communication centre at the time told the High Court in Cape Town on Tuesday: I received a call from a caller identifying himself as Henri. He phoned in for an ambulance. He was a bit hesitant and a made a sound like a giggle and I thought it was a prank. I asked for his name and his contact details. He was calm and co-operative and gave me his details ... To make sure he wasn t pranking I asked if he knew the name of another street close by. The way he sounded made me feel like it was a prank call. The normal reaction for a home invasion and assault of this nature is that people are frantic shouting screaming in tears they can t recall their contact numbers and are confused. But they are persistent | get the people out here now . She said she waited for the moment when he acted like someone who had witnessed murder but it didn t happen .The phone call lasted 20 minutes and was much longer than any of my other calls for assault .Philander said she told Van Breda she would get hold of the police at which point a prank caller will back down and put the phone down but he didn t. He wasn t anxious or agitated or any other such thing he was just cool and calm. The court was about to hear the clip but defence counsel Piet Botha objected because the sound was distorted. It will be heard tomorrow.
