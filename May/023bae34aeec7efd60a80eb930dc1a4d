Southern Kings flank Chris Cloete will miss the SA A fixture against the French Barbarians in Durban on June 16 after earning a one-week suspension.The suspension though is effectively for one match because it lasts until June 17 the next time Cloete is set to play due to the Super Rugby recess. The suspension follows a third yellow card of the season which Cloete received while playing against the Lions on Sunday and dents his prospects of impressing Springbok coach Allister Coetzee. A player who receives three yellow cards in a single Super Rugby season has to appear before a Foul Play Review Committee. In his finding Foul Play Review Committee Chairman Nigel Hampton QC ruled the following: "The Foul Play Review Committee conducted a detailed review of all the available evidence on all three incidents including video clips and referee reports. "With respect to sanction the Foul Play Review Committee deemed that a one week sanction was appropriate as all three yellow card offences were for foul play offences. "The Foul Play Review Committee cautioned the player as to his repeat offending and decided that the entry level for sanction in these circumstances of persistent foul play was a two week suspension."However given the player's good record and his acceptance of responsibility the suspension was reduced to a one-week period."The player is suspended up to and including 17 June 2017 being his next scheduled match. The player accepted that penalty." - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
