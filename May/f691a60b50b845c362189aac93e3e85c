Chippa United s attempt to seek punishment for Kaizer Chiefs defender Lorenzo Gordinho after a leg-breaking tackle on their midfielder Buyile Sali has been rejected by the Premier Soccer League officials said on Wednesday.Chippa wanted the league to take retrospective action after the tackle at Mbombela Stadium on April 15 as well as review the performance of referee Kulusande Qongqo.Gordinho received a caution for the challenge.But the club have been told by the PSL that the yellow card was appropriate sanction for the tackle after a review of the incident.Sali 27 had the bone above his ankle broken in the challenge and is out for the rest of the season prompting Chippa to seek redress against the 22-year-old defender.The PSL refer such complaints against referees to South African Football Association s review committee explained media officer Lux September on Wednesday.He said they are not empowered to change the referee s decision but only to possibly sanction him or recommend a possible misconduct charge against the player.In the past PSL prosecutors took retrospective action after violent acts during play but this has become infrequent.Morgan Gould then playing in defence for Chiefs was the last to be prosecuted in such a manner by the league handed a two-match ban and a record-breaking R100 000 fine for punching Wits striker Getaneh Kebede in 2013.Gould was found guilty of assault after being charged some two weeks after he punched the Ethiopian on the jaw.The defender knocked the Ethiopian cold in a bizarre incident during a league game between the two clubs at Soccer City which the referee ignored.In 2008 the PSL first prosecuted a player for assault when Gary Goldstone of Maritzburg United broke the jaw of Kaizer Chiefs forward Tshepo Bulu with a stiff-arm elbow that was not spotted by the referee at the game.It took less than week from the time of the incident for Goldstone to be handed a two-match ban and R10 000 fine.It was a decision that was hailed at the time after a wave of public protest at the prospect of Goldstone getting off scott free just because the match officials had not seen the assault or ignored it.But in Gordinho s case the referee did take action although the caution was seen by Chippa to be insufficient punishment for such a reckless tackle.
