Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has warned Amakhosi fans to choose wisely when they vote for their Carling Black Label Cup starting line-up.The voting and tickets sale opened yesterday. The much-anticipated Soweto derby will be played at the FNB Stadium on July 29. Voting can be done via SMS by dialing *120*660*, the under-liner code and then pressing the hash key.Speaking at the cup's media launch in Johannesburg yesterday, Komphela said: "Our fans should be careful when they vote for players who will start the game. You must select a balanced team," he warned."We know that the fans love their players but you cannot select a team with all the wingers or defenders. You must strike a balance."The seventh edition of the Carling Cup will give football fans a chance not just to vote for players they want to see on the pitch, but they will also vote for a formation which will be used by the teams.For the first time, supporters from neighbouring countries which include Zimbabwe, Namibia, Swaziland and Lesotho, will also have a say in the starting elevens of the pre-season friendly between the Soweto giants.
