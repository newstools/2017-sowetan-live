 WE WANT ANSWERS. That s the message on one of the posters brandished by angry residents from Elsies River waiting for murder accused Mortimer Saunders to appear at the Goodwood Magistrate s Court on Wednesday. Saunders stands accused of raping and killing three-year-old Courtney Pieters earlier this month. Not only was he a tenant at their modest Cape Flats home he was also her father s best friend according to family spokesperson Roegchanda Pascoe.Her story has shocked the nation and prompted a visit to the family by President Jacob Zuma last week. Zuma said it was one of the saddest things he had ever heard. That a man who stays here can rape the child kill the child in the bedroom ... and break every bone to make the child fit in a plastic bag ... It shows something has gone wrong with society he said.About 200 people from the community gathered outside the court on a chilly Wednesday morning. Police have had to block the entrance to the courtroom where Courtney s visibly distraught parents Juanita Pieters and Aron Fourie have taken a seat. More than 10 police officers have been deployed to the court room.
