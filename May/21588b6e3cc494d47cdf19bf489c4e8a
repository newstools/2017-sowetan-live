Bidvest Wits could become the 15th club in almost 50 years since the start of the old National Professional Soccer League the predecessor of today s Premier Soccer League to be crowned champions if they win at home on Wednesday and second placed Mamelodi Sundowns fail to match them at the same time.Wits who have been a part of the top-flight in South Africa for all but one season since 1978 are among the oldest surviving professional clubs in the country but have never before won domestic football s top prize.With a two-point advantage over Sundowns they can be crowned champions with one match to go but only if results go their way.They must win at home against Polokwane City and hope that Sundowns are unable to beat Maritzburg United in Atteridgeville at the same time.If that happens it would end a long search for the title since the club previously attached to Wits University but now an independent entity owned by billionaire businessman Brian Joffee worked their way up from the second division in 1977.They would become the latest in the list of first-time winners since SuperSport United won a maiden crown in 2008 and join 14 other clubs as South African champions since 1971.Kaizer Chiefs with 12 titles lead the list of past champions followed by Mamelodi Sundowns (10) and Orlando Pirates (nine).The big three have long dominated domestic competition and Sundowns could yet win an 11th title and retain their crown if Wits falter in their last two matches.The past league champions also include AmaZulu Highlands Park Jomo Cosmos Santos and SuperSport United.Several now defunct clubs were also champions in the old NPSL and National Soccer League Lusitano (1978) Durban City (1982-83) Bush Bucks (1985) Rangers (1986) Cape Town Spurs (1995) and Manning Rangers (1997). - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
