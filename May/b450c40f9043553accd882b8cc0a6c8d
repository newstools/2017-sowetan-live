The irony of launching the Carling Black Label Cup at this time is that Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates could actually finish the season empty handed.The date for this year's Black Label Cup, a preseason exhibition match, was confirmed as July 29 at the launch yesterday at Park Station, Johannesburg.And while fans from both sides have been urged to start voting, they are likely to have nothing to celebrate by the end of the current season.Bucs coach Kjell Jonevret believes his team can make up for their terrible season by adding the Nedbank Cup to their collection, while finishing at least in the top eight in the Absa Premiership."I know we probably have to win two or three games to finish in the top eight and we are also in the semifinals of the (Nedbank) Cup," said Jonevret."There are many big teams who want trophies every year, but at least we still have a chance and other teams don't have that chance."His counterpart Steve Komphela cut a frustrated figure trying to understand how they have made their lives difficult in the league race by losing 3-2 to Cape Town City and drawing 2-2 with SuperSport United in their last two matches.Amakhosi, like their rivals, are facing a second consecutive season without a trophy. Ever an optimist, Komphela is not throwing in the towel."It's important for Chiefs to campaign and win championships, but it is not easy," Komphela reacted."There are phases in everything; there is a phase where everything comes to a halt and then you start the process. The process goes on and you have to go through the maturity stage and you have to deliver."But the same fans who cheered for Komphela when he was introduced yesterday will not be in his corner if they fail to win the league this season.Komphela, though, believes the club is on the right track and will fight their way back to win trophies in future.Chiefs next face Golden Arrows on Saturday, while Pirates meet Wits (tomorrow) and Sundowns (Sunday).
