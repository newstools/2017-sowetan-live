Defending champion Irvette van Zyl withdrew due to illness."This victory will help me earn some respect in athletics, especially back home [in Kenya]. This will open many doors in sports," Gachaga said.He took home R25000 after winning the 12km race that attracted 14000 participants.Lesotho's Nomakoe Nkhasi set the pace during the early part of the race, with locals Elroy Galent and Gladwin Mzazi not far off.It was evident that the winner would come from either Gachaga, Nkhasi or Gelant. With only 3km to spare, Gachaga maintained his phenomenal pace and won.
