New Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter finally showed his hand when he announced his first squad as national team boss.Baxter succeeded the sacked Ephraim Shakes Mashaba early this month and there was massive interest in the kind of players he d select for Bafana s tricky away 2019 African Nations Cup qualifier against Nigeria. When I m selecting this squad I m looking for some continuity Baxter said on Thursday. The time that s been spent with the players prior to me arriving we don t just want to throw the baby out with the bath water. I certainly want to bring in some players that I believe can add value. And I certainly want to reward some players.
