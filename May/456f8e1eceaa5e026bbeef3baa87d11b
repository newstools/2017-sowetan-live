Highlands Park co-coach Thierry Mulonzo has made a bold promise to the club s supporters ahead of their crunch Absa Premiership clash with Mamelodi Sundowns in Tembisa on Saturday. We will end up victorious I guarantee you that he told Times Media Digital. We want it more than them. We know what is at stake."The players in their conversations at training in the changeroom and at home are talking about it. They know what relegation means. Any team in the country that plays Sundowns is on the back foot from the start because of the quality they have in their squad they are a fantastic team. But it is 11 versus 11 on the field and we will go for the win. The permutations for the relegation dog-fight on the final day of the league season are complex but victory would guarantee Highlands Park survival even though they currently sit in the relegation play-off position.That is because the two teams who sit one point above them Free State Stars and Chippa United are in action against one another.Bottom side Baroka have 25 points an a -18 goal-difference with Highlands Park on 26 (-18). Stars (27 -11) and Chippa (27 -5) are both still in danger but one can save themselves along with Bloemfontein Celtic (28 -12).Baroka travel to top-eight chasing Ajax Cape Town on the final day who have been in excellent form of late while Celtic have a difficult away-day at Maritzburg United who also need to win to ensure a top-half finish.Assuming Baroka lose at Ajax and there is a winner between Stars and Chippa a point will not be enough to move Highlands out of second-bottom which would mean a difficult battle in the play-offs against National First Division sides Black Leopards and Stellenbosch FC to save themselves. It is in our own hands Mulonzo says. We will do everything to win the game we are playing at home mentally we are very strong spiritually we are very strong and the vibe in the team is very good. The players are looking forward to the game. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
