Bafana Bafana midfielder May Mahlangu is having the time of his life in Romania. He reflects on his nine months at Dinamo Bucuresti.You've been with Dinamo for close to a year. How is it going?God has been great. I might win the league on Saturday as we are playing the last game (against Astra in the championship round). We are also in the Romanian Cup final and we are playing a team called ACS Poli Timisoara (May 20).How has it been for you since joining the club?It's been a journey, from the bench to consistency for 90 minutes. Rest assured I've made my mark . I've settled in quite well but there's always room for improvement.You have made 24 appearances for the club this season and that's probably difficult for any foreign player.I guess I'm used to it now. Over the years I've learnt I will suffer when I'm in another land, but there will come a time where I will go home and be able to appreciate all my efforts and live like a king.How are the Dinamo fans treating you?Dinamo fans put their hearts in the game and always show their support to the team. There are some who even tell me they used to follow me since my days in Sweden with Helsingborgs, and others paint portraits of me. It's truly overwhelming.Having played in other leagues like in Sweden, Belgium and Turkey, how does Romania compare?I'd say it's even better because I've grown as a player and matured through the years. My game is more tactful and maturity is an attitude built by experience.What do you get up to outside football in Romania?In football your teammates become your brothers. We've travelled Romania learning about landmarks and historical sites.Bafana Bafana have a new coach (Stuart Baxter) and soon will be playing in the Afcon qualifiers starting next month. What are you hoping for?As I've said before, call me any time I'm ready. I'm looking forward to donning my national colours with pride. It's time to make South Africans proud.
