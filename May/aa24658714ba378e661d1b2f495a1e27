Much could be decided at the top and the bottom of the National First Division after the full round of midweek matches to be played on Tuesday and Wednesday.Thanda Royal Zulu who have led for the entire campaign can clinch automatic promotion to the Premier League if they claim a home win over second-placed Stellenbosch FC on Wednesday.Even a draw will be enough if Black Leopards don t get more than a draw in their tough away trip to Royal Eagles.Thanda have 10 wins and three draws from their 13 home games this season and coach Roger Sikhakhane has them dominant in front of their own Richard s Bay fans.For Sikhakhane it would be a personal triumph having also previously gained promotion with Chippa United but not gone on to be given a fair crack in the Premier League.Thanda were last in the top-flight in the 2008/09 season and have faced a number of relegation scares from the NFD since then but managed to hold on to their status and are now back on the brink of the big-time.At the foot of the table former Premier Soccer League champions Santos could follow Moroka Swallows into near oblivion with relegation to the ABC Motsepe League.Santos won the league under Gordon Igesund in the 2000/01 season and were also 2001 Bob Save Super Bowl winners to go with the 2003 Absa Cup and 2002 BP Top Eight.But those days are long gone and following their relegation from the top-flight in 2011/12 they have been in steady decline.They are currently eight points from safety with four matches to play but their relegation could be confirmed this week if Milano United win at home against AmaZulu on Tuesday and Santos then don t get a win at home to Jomo Cosmos on Wednesday.Swallows demise is just about complete and whether Santos could return from the depths of the third tier and be a force again is a big question. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
