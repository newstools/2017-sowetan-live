The Cheetahs may be finding their Super Rugby waters to be very choppy but the Lions Sharks and the Southern Kings have been making hay in the early winter sunshine. The less said about the half-centurion Stormers and their New Zealand tribulations the better.At least they're at an end with their date with defending champions the Hurricanes at the Westpac Stadium on Friday morning.At best it could be ugly but Super Rugby has thrown up stranger results.FRIDAY Hurricanes vs Stormers (9.35am Westpac Stadium Wellington)After their win against the Chiefs three weeks ago no one would have predicted that the Stormers' New Zealand tour would be an unmitigated disaster.They've fallen off tackles like kids falling off tries and conceded first-phase and counter-attacking tries like they're going out of fashion.Whether they've learnt any lessons remains to be seen but should their season taper off badly this tour would have provided the shaky foundations for their collapse.The Stormers were pretty before they were tested but at the time of asking they were found wanting badly.Hurricanes: 15 Jordie Barrett 14 Cory Jane 13 Vince Aso 12 Ngani Laumape 11 Julian Savea 10 Beauden Barrett 9 Thomas Perenara 8 Ardie Savea 7 Callum Gibbins 6 Brad Shields 5 Vaea Fifita 4 Mark Abbott 3 Jeff Toomaga-Allen 2 Ricky Riccitelli 1 Ben May.Replacements:

Vermaak.Replacements: 16 Ramone Samuels 17 Caylib Oosthuizen 18 Oliver Kebble 19 John Schickerling 20 Sikhumbuzo Notshe 21 Jano Vermaak 22 Dan Kriel 23 Bjorn Basson.Cheetahs vs Highlanders (7.10pm Free State Stadium Bloemfontein) Cheetahs coach Franco Smith said his team is not in a slump but six consecutive defeats tell another story.It could be a seventh consecutive loss should the 2015 champions decide to enjoy Bloemfontein as they did in the past.The Cheetahs must hope the television match official will be on their side after two dubious and match-turning calls in their 48-21 loss to the Crusaders last week.With this game being their last before their difficult tour of New Zealand it's imperative the Cheetahs get out of their rut.Cheetahs: 15 Clayton Blommetjies 14 Sergeal

Rebels outfit.They were put to the sword by the energised Southern Kings and the Lions are a far better unit in terms of defensive organisation and attacking structure.The Lions also have the added carrot of beating all five Australian teams and a big win here could send some shivers down the spines of Stephen Larkham's men in Canberra.Rebels: 15 Reece Hodge 14 Sefa Naivalu 13 Tom English 12

Volmink.Sharks vs Force (3.05pm King's Park Durban) Having subjected their fans to a snore draw in their last home game the Sharks need to repay their faithful with a handsome win against one of Super Rugby's bottom feeders.Robert du Preez's side showed excellent character and skill to win against the Jaguares while the Forces came away with nothing despite their best attempts to frustrate the Lions.A golden bonus point opportunity lies in wait for the Durban side if Dave Wessels's charges decide to play rugby.There's also the significant matter of Patrick Lambie making his comeback from injury.Sharks: 15 Rhyno Smith 14 Kobus van Wyk 13 Lukhanyo Am 12 Jeremy Ward 11 Sibusiso Nkosi 10 Curwin Bosch 9 Michael Claassens 8 Daniel du Preez 7 Jean-Luc du Preez 6 Philip van der Walt (captain)

Lewis Carmichael 20 Richard Hardwick 21 Mitchell Short 22 Luke Burton 23 Peter GrantBulls vs Crusaders (5.05pm Loftus Versfeld Pretoria) The Crusaders haven't won in Tshwane in over nine years but under Scott Robertson's tutelage they've morphed into an all-round blockbusting team who either specialise in powerful first halves or rousing second half comebacks.The Bulls have been abysmal despite their consecutive home wins against the Jaguares and the Crusaders. Those sides were makeweights.The seven-time champions are the real deal with an axe to grind.Bulls: 15 Warrick Gelant 14 Travis Ismaiel 13 Jesse Kriel 12 Burger Odendaal 11 Jamba Ulengo 10 Tian Schoeman 9 Piet van Zyl 8 Hanro Liebenberg 7 Jacques Potgieter 6 Nick de Jager 5 Lodewyk de Jager 4 Jason Jenkins 3 Trevor Nyakane 2 Adriaan Strauss (captain) 1 Pierre Schoeman.Replacements: 16 Jaco Visagie 17 Lizo Gqoboka 18 Jacobie Adriaanse 19 Rudolph Snyman 20 Jannes Kirsten 21 Rudy Paige 22 Francois Brummer 23 Jan SerfonteinCrusaders: 15 David Havili 14 Seta Tamanivalu 13 Jack Goodhue 12 Tim Bateman 11 George Bridge 10 Richie Mo'unga 9 Mitchell Drummond 8 Jordan Taufua 7 Matt Todd (captain) 6 Pete Samu 5 Scott Barrett 4 Luke Romano 3 Owen Franks 2 Codie Taylor 1 Wyatt Crockett.Replacements: 16 Andrew Makalio 17 Joe Moody 18 Michael Alaalatoa 19 Quinten Strange 20 Heiden Bedwell-Curtis 21 Bryn Hall 22 Mitchell Hunt 23 Ryan Crotty. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
