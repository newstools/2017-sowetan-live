He wants Bafana to become a team Nigeria and other powerhouses on the continent dread playing against."Anybody who thinks that Stuart Baxter is a coach who is going to stifle and suffocate our free flowing spirit, have no fear, that won't happen."I want us to be a skilful, technical, mobile, aggressive, tactically smart team that Nigeria don't want to play against. I want them to say 'not them again'," Baxter said.As he will not have a lot of time to prepare for the game, Baxter is hoping the fact that some of the players have worked with him at club level will work in his and the team's favour. The likes of Itumeleng Khune, Lorenzo Gordinho, Mulomowandau Mathoho and Dean Furman will know what the coach is all about and will not have any trouble understanding what he wants.
