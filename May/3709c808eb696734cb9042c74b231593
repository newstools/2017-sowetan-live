Polokwane City coach Luc Eymael's troubles with the club are seemingly unending after he was frozen out despite honouring a PSL ruling that he return last Friday.Eymael, according to sources, has been prevented from training the team, but the coach is not prepared to talk about the matter. "I don't want to comment until my case is over," Eymael said yesterday.He has been at loggerheads with the club since his resignation on March 9 to join Bloemfontein Celtic a day later.City then lodged a complaint with the PSL's Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) that they were not aware he was leaving, and on April 14, Eymael was ordered to return to the Limpopo club without having sat on the bench for Celtic.Initially, Eymael refused to return to City, claiming his life would be "in danger" at the club. The DRC responded by fining him R100000.The 57-year-old relented in the end and went back to the club on Friday, but he's not been able to resume work."The coach came back and went to the clubhouse in Palmfontein with a letter of apology, but he's not having any luck trying to reconcile with the club," reveals a club source."It was war on Monday. The coach came and when he was busy putting the cones in preparation for training, Bernard Molekwa (who's been acting as a caretaker coach) was busy removing them.Eymael asked what Molekwa was doing and Molekwa told him he's in charge. So Eymael didn't train the team and he left before it ended (on Monday)," added the source.Eymael went back to training yesterday morning and was spotted by Sowetan walking around at the training base at Noordelikes Rugby club."It looks like the club hasn't even given him a work car, because he was driving a hired car and I think he's also paying for his own accommodation," added the source.Molekwa refused to comment when contacted and instead referred us to the club's chief operations officer (COO) Tincy Tema.Tema, too, also refused to comment claiming he's not been at the club recently and said we should contact the club's chairman, Johnny Mogaladi, who couldn't be reached.
