The North West High Court has granted the defense of two men accused of killing a Coligny boy to proceed with the bail application today.The accused Pieter Doorewaard, 34, and Phillip Schutte, 27, were remanded in custody after they appeared in court on Friday and magistrate Wikus van Loggerenberg postponed proceedings to May 9 for formal bail application.Loggerenberg has also since recused himself from the case, citing safety concerns for his family. But in an urgent court application yesterday, the North West High Court judge Nadia Gutta set aside the decision for the postponement and ordered the matter be heard today in the Coligny Magistrate's Court.Matlhomola "Fani" Mosweu body was found on Sunday, 11 days after he had left home and his death sparking a violent protest in the area.Advocate Hennie du Plessis, who represents Schutte, accused number two, said the postmortem results expected to be read out in court today will determine the severity of the murder.National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Frank Lesenyego said the reason for the 11 days postponement was to get a replacement magistrate. He said the state was going to oppose bail, judging by the current situation in Coligny.Matlhomola's parents confirmed that they only found out on Sunday about their son's death. They became aware of his demise when a picture of his corpse was shown to them by a community member who came looking for them at their church.Police and residents had spent a week searching for the boy's family.Matlhomola's father Saki Dingake, 45, said they were shocked when a local school principal arrived at church and showed him a picture of his son."I was shocked. I knew that there was a boy who was killed, but never thought it was mine."His mother Mmankhibidu Mosweu, 43, said she last saw Matlhomola on April 19 at home in Scotland informal settlement, when his grandmother sent him to buy paraffin."I never suspected anything was wrong when he did not come back home because we were used to him being gone from home for days, but he would eventually come back."Matlhomola was the third of seven children, and he was 17, not 12 as it was earlier reported .He was apparently severely assaulted, and later died, after he was allegedly caught stealing sunflowers on a farm in Scotland.Mosweu said she wanted those who killed her son to be killed too. The family lives in a one-roomed shack with no electricity or running water.
