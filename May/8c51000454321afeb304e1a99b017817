Being ridiculed for being old by fellow students at Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) in Umlazi, Durban, did not break a domestic worker's spirit.Phumzile Ngwane, 42, finally obtained a national diploma in human resources management last week.She said studying with the youngsters was not easy."Students were saying that I'm old, and asked what I was doing in a place for young people? My life was very difficult but I pulled through with love of God and help of lecturers."I would go to every class and put in extra hours of studying when others were sleeping. I knew what I wanted and I went about making those dreams a reality," Ngwane said.She said she even battled to make friends and was a loner at the institution.Ngwane obtained 80% in labour law, and 75% in human resources management. She first registered with MUT in 1997 but had to leave because she ran out of funds."I had to get a job to sustain my son, since his father died when he was just four years old," said Ngwane.Her husband Bonginkosi Ngwane died in 2002."I have been working as a domestic worker for 14 years, earning R900."Ngwane said she believed in hard work and not receiving hand-outs. However, she said her boss voluntarily gave her R2000 for registration, since her meagre salary could not be enough.The rest of her fees were paid by National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS)."My life has been hell since I lost my husband. Studying while I [was working] has been [difficult]."Everyone has their own obstacles to overcome. You just have to surround yourself with positive people that wish to see you succeed. But at the end of the day you are ultimately responsible for achieving your dreams," she said with excitement.Ngwane has also registered for the Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with the University of South Africa.
