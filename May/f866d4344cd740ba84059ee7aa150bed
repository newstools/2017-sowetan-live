Only three Kaizer Chiefs players remain at the club from George Lebese's debut season nine years ago.The left winger made his first official appearance as a substitute in the 3-2 loss to Maritzburg United in September 2008, but some of his teammates who featured in that match, like Tshepo Bulu and Jimmy Tau, are not even playing the game anymore.Chiefs captain Itumeleng Khune and midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala were also part of the team at the time, and including Lebese, they are the only three players of a squad of over 30 that were at the club in the 2008/09 season.And while Khune and Tshabalala have gone on to represent South Africa at senior national team level and won individual awards, the same cannot be said for Lebese.The 28-year-old is frustrated by his lack of consistency, which sometimes has been caused by injuries. "Disappointing for me. It's more similar to what the club is going through, so it is basically a season to forget," he reflected."I just have to look back and work harder on [my weaker] areas - goalscoring and contributing more for the team."The Mamelodi-born midfielder has played 197 official matches for Amakhosi at an average of 21.8 matches a season. He has scored 30 goals.Lebese expects the club to bounce back next season."We know where we went wrong and we know our mistakes. It's very disappointing that [for two seasons ], we didn't bring anything to the club."Very disappointing."
