The Cuban government s traditional May Day parade Monday is the last to be overseen by President Raul Castro and the first without his late brother and revolutionary predecessor Fidel.The May 1 rally draws hundreds of thousands of Cubans into Havana s Revolution Square in a sea of red, white and blue national flags and portraits of Fidel Castro. But he died in November and Raul Castro, after just over a decade in power, has said he will step aside in February 2018. Raul Castro has been cautiously opening up Cuba s state-run economy and strengthening its foreign relations notably by re-establishing diplomatic ties with the United States. But Monday s parade has the feel of the end of an era. It is not clear who will take Castro s place next year. Most rumors suggest it will be Miguel Diaz-Canel, 56, vice-president of the State Council. Despite ministerial experience and party credentials, he is seen as lacking a support base in the military. There is very high uncertainty about 2018, said Pavel Vidal, a former official of Cuba s central bank and an academic at Colombia s Javeriana University. One could expect a process of continuity of Raul Castro s reforms, he added, but not at the same speed. Cuba s economic fortunes depend largely on another country that will see May Day marches on Monday: Venezuela. Monday s parade in Havana will make a show of support for Venezuela s leftist government which is facing violent opposition protests, top Cuban labor union leader Ulises Guilarte said. Venezuela sells cut-price oil to its leftist allies in Havana. Cuba is currently in recession, dragged down by its ally s economic crisis. Analyst Andrew Otazo of Washington-based Cuba Study Group told AFP that Cuba has started looking to other oil exporters in case the Venezuelan government collapses.
