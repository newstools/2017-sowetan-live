In an unprecedented move aimed at finally bringing an end to the long-running club versus country debate Sports Minister Thembelani Thulas Nxesi is exploring the possibility of implementing legislation that could make it compulsory for athletes to represent the country ahead of international competition.This idea is a reaction to the decision by Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United to refuse to release their players to the Under-20 national team that left for the World Cup in South Korea on Wednesday. My department is investigating international best practice which would include legislative option " said Nxesi on Thursday."For example the Spanish government has passed a law which makes it compulsory for athletes to represent their country first ahead of any competing obligations including to their local teams."I will be reverting to the South African Football Association (Safa) and the Premier Soccer League (PSL) with my findings and recommendations in the near future. Wits and United appeared briefly before an urgent Safa disciplinary hearing on Wednesday after their refusal to release their players to the World Cup-bound Amajita squad but their case was postponed without a later date being confirmed. This is a serious matter as it denies our Under-20 squad the muscle to go and give their best in the upcoming Fifa Under-20 tournament in South Korea " the Sports Minister said."It also denies young players valuable international experience and the pride of representing their country. The struggle for the release of players is a historical problem of club versus country."Safa and government have affirmed on many occasions that it is our patriotic duty and an essential part of government priorities of social cohesion and nation building that our best possible team represent the country in any major tournament on the world stage including the Under-20 Fifa World Cup."It remains the responsibility of all clubs to continue to encourage our talented young stars to go and become good ambassadors and positive role models for all their peers by enabling them to take part in international competitions and events. Safa approached the ministry of sport and recreation to assist them in finding a permanent solution to a problem that has continued to affect all national teams when it comes to international competitions. Safa failed on a number of occasions to strike a compromise with the PSL therefore leading to the current impasse."Safa has therefore requested me to investigate what legislative options exist to ensure that our country is represented by our best available talent."I urge the parties to find a solution in the short-term one which recognizes the primacy of the national team but which may allow for flexibility in very special circumstances something which could even form the basis of a binding Memorandum of Agreement. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
