China has issued new internet regulations increasing Communist Party control over online news providers, the latest step in the country's push to tighten policing of the web.The ruling party oversees a vast apparatus designed to censor online content deemed politically sensitive, maintaining that such measures are necessary for the protection of national security.Sites blocked due to their content or sensitivity, among them Facebook and Twitter, cannot be accessed without special software that allows users to bypass strict controls.New regulations released by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) on Tuesday will increase party control over who can publish what online, from June 1. All websites, apps, forums, blogs, microblogs, social media accounts, instant messaging and live streaming platforms and other entities that select or edit news will need a licence to post reports or commentary about the government, economy, military, foreign affairs, and social issues, the CAC said.
