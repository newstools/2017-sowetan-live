In a bizarre turn of events, Dan Malesela yesterday said he was returning to Chippa United as coach after the club had placed him on special leave last month, due to poor results."Yes, I am coming back to PE [Port Elizabeth]," said Malesela, as he was about to board a flight from OR Tambo International Airport yesterday."It's not important how my return to Chippa came about. I am coming back not to really help but to fix the situation."Malesela said the request from the club to come back did not come as a shock but he had to think long and hard before he made the decision to return."I was not shocked neither was I surprised nor did I expect it. This was a request from the club and there were a lot of considerations that I needed to make and discussions with my family. I also had to discuss this issue with my manager, if it was okay or not."I am not going to ask anybody why this, why not that. It's going to be business as usual."I am not angry with anybody. You know we make decisions in football. Sometimes they are right, sometimes they are not , so it's normal for me."Asked if he would be able to save the Chilli Boys from going down, Malesela replied: "I have a feeling that something can be done."Chippa host Supersport United on Wednesday after going down 1-0 to struggling Highlands Park on Friday night.The result saw Chippa drop to second-last on the log.
