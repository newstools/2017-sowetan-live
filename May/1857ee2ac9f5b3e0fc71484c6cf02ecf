Kaizer Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung has said that his team need to sign quality defenders for next season.Speaking of the positive and negative aspects of Chiefs 2016-17 season where they seem likely to finish no higher than fourth in the Absa Premiership and without a cup trophy Motaung highlighted Chiefs defence as being a weak point. I must say our defence this season has not done us any good. They have actually dropped a bit (from 2015-16) Chiefs chairman said on Thursday.Asked if Amakhosi would go to the market for defenders in the off-season Motaung replied: Yes we might because to be honest some of the players you could see their legs were gone. And so we can t wait until the reality kicks in. In the league fifth-placed Chiefs have conceded 25 goals in 28 games not the worst defensive record of teams in the top five.Third-placed Cape Town City have conceded 31 and fourth-placed SuperSport United the same amount as Chiefs on 25.Mamelodi Sundowns in second place in the PSL have let in a stingy 16 goals while first-placed Bidvest Wits have allowed 21.It is the timing with which Chiefs have conceded that has been costly such as their injury-time goals conceded that led to a crippling two draws and a defeat in their last three games. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
