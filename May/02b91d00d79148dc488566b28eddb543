All three South African representatives in this year s African club competition plunged themselves into immediate peril by failing to win at home in their opening group games at the weekend as the effects of a gruelling campaign became more evident.Holders Mamelodi Sundowns could come to regret not turning their dominance over St George of Ethiopia into three points as they were held goalless at Atteridgeville on Saturday in a tepid start to their Champions Leafgue defence.But Pitso Mosimane s side looked devoid of their crispness and sharpness and played with a blunt edge despite having the bulk of the possession.The fatigue was all too evident despite the coach resting the likes of Percy Tau and Thapelo Morena and trying to freshen up the side.The coach compared the performance with the standard of an over 40 Sunday league team.St George was supposed to be an easy launch pad for the Brazilians who now have much tougher assignment away at AS Vita Club of the Democratic republic of Congo next week and then twice in a row against Tunisia s powerful Esperance.In the Confederation Cup both SuperSport United and Platinum Stars made the conscious decision to use their reserves with just a handful of regulars to provide a spine to the team.And it was no surprise both were also held to draws.The preference to concentrate on domestic targets remains a priority for the club with SuperSport looking to next month s Nedbank Cup final and Stars having a more immediate meeting with Kaizer Chiefs on Wednesday as they still hold out hopes of a top eight place.All three South African outfits now have to travel next week for midweek matches in the second round of their respective group campaigns.Sundowns go to Kinshasa for what is always a testing trip; SuperSport travel to Gabon while Stars have a short trip across the border for a meeting with Mbabane Swallows of Swaziland. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
