President Jacob Zuma's supporters are planning to publicly embarrass Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, who they blame for May Day chaos.President Jacob Zuma's supporters are planning to publicly embarrass Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, who they blame for May Day chaos.ANC Youth League president Collen Maine did not mince his words yesterday, saying: "We are going to boo Ramaphosa back and it won't be nice. We are going to make life difficult for him. We are going to boo him in an ANC meeting before we boo him at a rally."Maine told Sowetan that the rejection of Zuma by workers was done in the name of Ramaphosa."People were mobilised by the anti-Zuma faction to embarrass Zuma. Zuma, Baleka (Mbete) and (Jessie) Duarte were booed but Ramaphosa, Gwede (Mantashe) and (Zweli) Mkhize were allowed to speak."We are alive to the fact that this is informed by the factional battles within the ANC," he said.The main May rally was held in Bloemfontein but Zuma, together with Cosatu and SACP leaders, could not address the rally as workers rejected him.They said he should go.Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) chairman Kebby Maphatsoe lashed out at Cosatu leaders, accusing them of playing into the hands of the enemies."They have no right to say the president of the ANC cannot address the workers," he said.Maphatsoe, a staunch Zuma supporter, also called on Cosatu to stop meddling in the affairs of the ANC. "For them to say they want Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to be the next president is wrong."Cosatu must focus on regaining lost ground after they expelled Numsa because of factional battles."Cosatu has taken a decision that Zuma must step down.A pro-Zuma supporter and ANC NEC member said the collapse of the May Day rally in Bloemfontein and booing of some ANC leaders does not warrant an urgent meeting."What happened is not a threat," the NEC member said.Zuma supporters want former AU Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be the next ANC leader and ultimately head of state.
