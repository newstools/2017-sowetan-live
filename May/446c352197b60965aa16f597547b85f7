Bidvest Wits forward star Phakamani Mahlambi has been withdrawn from the Amajita squad for the Fifa Under-20 World Cup in South Korea with a hamstring injury.Mahlambi has been replaced by Ajax Cape Town defender Sirgio Kammies the South African Football Association (Safa) stated in a statement issued on Wednesday.The withdrawal of arguably the brightest U-20 talent available to South Africa comes as a big blow to Amajita coach Thabo Senong and his squad.Mahlambi also missed the Rio Olympics in August last year with SA s U-23 team due to a debilitating and almost career-ending knee ligament injury.Safa said Mahlambi sustained his injury while training with his club . As per the FIFA rules for the tournament no player can be replaced in the squad without proof of an injury Safa s statement read.Mahlambi had been the figure of a tug-of-war battle between Absa Premiership title-chasing Wits and Safa who called the club to a disciplinary hearing for not releasing the player in time for the South African U-20s departure for the World Cup last week.Amajita open their tournament against Japan in Suwon South Korea on Sunday.Bafana Bafana and SA U-20 team doctor Thulani Ngwenya revealed in the statement that Mahlambi s injury had been inspected and found to be very significant . Judging from the evidence revealed by the Ultrasound film that has been sent by Mahlambi s club and has been forwarded to the FIFA Medical office the player s injury is very significant and unfortunately can t be managed before any of our World Cup games Ngwenya said. Surgery would be a better option to enhance recovery however he will still not be ready for this World Cup Tournament and it is for this reason that he has been withdrawn. Amajita are also waiting on Wits right-back Reeve Frosler and SuperSport United central midfielder Teboho Mokoena to report in South Korea who have also been at the centre of disputes between their clubs and Safa.SA coach Senong said: It is very unfortunate that Phakamani can t be with us but we have to forge ahead. This has also given us a chance to re-evaluate our squad so we decided to call up Sirgio Kammies so as to add numbers to our defence because we feel that we have enough strength in attack. Kammies was part of the team s preparations prior to the U20 Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Zambia (in March) as well as the World Cup so he knows the team and how we operate. South Africa s group at the World Cup also includes Italy and Uruguay. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
