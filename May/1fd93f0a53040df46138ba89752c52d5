Algeria, where legislative elections are to be held tomorrow , has major oil and gas reserves but faces a financial crisis because of the collapse in oil prices.The country has been led since 1999 by Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was re-elected to a fourth term in 2014 despite severe health problems.Algeria became a French colony in 1830 after three centuries of Ottoman domination. Independence came in July 1962 after a bloody independence war that lasted nearly eight years.In September 1963, prime minister Ahmed Ben Bella became the founding president of independent Algeria.In July 1965, Houari Boumediene of the National Liberation Front (FLN), which had led the struggle against French colonial rule, overthrew Ben Bella. He ran Algeria as a one-party state until his death in 1978.Colonel Chadli Bendjedid was then elected president, a post he held until he was forced to resign in January 1992.In October 1988, protests rocked the capital Algiers, prompting the authorities to declare a state of emergency.The army clamped down on demonstrators, but introduced political reforms which brought an end to the single-party system.However, when the country held its first multiparty legislative poll in 1991, the army stepped in to prevent the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) winning and setting up an Islamic state.That sparked a civil war that claimed some 200000 lives, with the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) claiming responsibility for many large massacres of civilians.In 1999, at the height of the war, Bouteflika, backed by the army, won an election marred by the withdrawal of all six of his rivals, who alleged rampant fraud. Bouteflika launched a reconciliation programme that saw thousands of Islamist fighters lay down their arms.In April 2014, Bouteflika was re-elected for a fourth term with over 81% of the vote, despite a 2013 stroke that had confined him to a wheelchair.His mobility and speech severely reduced, he has rarely appeared in public since. In 1994 Algeria began liberalising its state-controlled economy, which is almost entirely dependent on oil and gas sales.Those exports make up 95% of external revenue and contribute 60% of the state budget. The drop in world oil prices has forced the government to increase taxes and abandon numerous public projects.
