Cheetahs coach Franco Smith is on a highway to nowhere and a loss to the Highlanders on Friday evening could confirm their junk Super Rugby status. While they haven't capitulated entirely their competitive edge is waning quickly and they will need to be at their best to ward off the threat posed by Tony Brown's side.To that effect Smith has made five changes to the unit that was soundly beaten by the Crusaders on Saturday evening.William Small-Smith Tian Meyer Paul Schoeman Carl Wegner and Fred Zeilinga will be tasked with changing the team's fortunes.They didn't even have their customary half-time lead against the Crusaders even though they were robbed of a certain try just before half-time because of indifferent officiating.Small-Smith will have big questions asked of his defensive fortitude at inside centre where he will be lining up alongside captain Francois Venter.The engine room that did admirable service in the face of a brutal Crusaders onslaught sees Wegner start alongside Francois Uys with Armandt Koster being demoted to the bench.Uzair Caseem will also be on bench duty where a loose trio of Teboho Oupa Mohoje Henco Venter and Paul Schoeman will be asked to keep Liam Squire and company at arm's length.A re-jigged half-back pairing sees Tian Meyer and Fred Zeilinga teaming up with the former gaining his 50th Super Rugby cap.Brown also picked a strong side that will be without star fullback Ben Smith where the likes of Elliot Dixon Richard Buckman and Ash Dixon will be easing themselves on from the bench after their respective injury layoffs.Teams:Cheetahs: 15 Clayton Blommetjies 14 Sergeal Petersen 13 Francois Venter 12 William Small-Smith 11 Raymond Rhule 10 Fred Zeilinga 9 Tian Meyer 8 Henco Venter 7 Teboho Mohoje 6 Paul Schoeman 5 Francois Uys 4 Carl Wegner 3 Johan Coetzee 2 Torsten van Jaarsveld 1 Ox NcheReplacements: 16 Elandre Huggett 17 Charles Marais 18 Tom Botha 19 Armandt Koster 20 Uzair Caseem 21 Neil Jordaan 22 Shaun Venter 23 Niel MaraisHighlanders: 15 Matt Faddes 14 Waisake Naholo 13 Malakai Fekitoa 12 Rob Thompson 11 Patrick Osborne 10 Marty Banks 9 Aaron Smith 8 Luke Whitelock (captain) 7 Dillon Hunt 6 Liam Squire 5 Tom Franklin 4 Joe Wheeler 3 Siosuia Halanukonuka 2 Liam Coltman 1 Daniel Lienert-Brown.Replacements: 16 Ash Dixon 17 Aki Seiuli 18 Siate Tokolahi 19 Elliot Dixon 20 Gareth Evans 21 Kayne Hammington 22 Fletcher Smith 23 Richard Buckman. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
