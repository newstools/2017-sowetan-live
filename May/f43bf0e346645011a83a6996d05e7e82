SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter will be on the bench for their match against Bloemfontein Celtic, following his release from hospital.The 63-year-old missed the club's recent win against Bidvest Wits (1-0), and the match against his former club Kaizer Chiefs (2-2), after being hospitalised following SuperSport's Nedbank Cup win over Amakhosi two weeks ago."I'm going back to training today (yesterday). They did the operation to cut away the poison, and that was okay. Now it's just very sore, but I've stopped all the painkillers and all the antibiotics," Baxter told Sowetan.Initially, the club said that Baxter was suffering from an undisclosed ailment, but he has since shed more light."They think it was some sort of a bite (on his legs), but they can't be 100% sure."It was highly toxic in my blood."I went in, because it was swelling very quickly and I was worried that it could be cancerous you know," he continued."The doctors are happy with it, so they are allowing me to go back to training. I will be very, very slow and very gentle."Baxter added that he will be on the bench against Bloemfontein Celtic in today's league encounter at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville at 7.30pm.In his absence, assistant coach Kaitano Tembo has been in charge.
