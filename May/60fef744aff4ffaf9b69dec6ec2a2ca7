The African National Congress has expressed disbelief at Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas decision to reshuffle her cabinet without consulting the ruling party.Lucas announced her cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday ahead of the provincial conference which began on Thursday.She announced that the following people would serve in new positions:- MEC for Economic Development Finance and Treasury Gail Parker - MEC for Transport Safety and Liaison Sandra Beukes - MEC for Public Works Bongiwe Mbinqo-Gigaba- New MEC for Sports Arts and Culture Mxolisi SokatshaFormer Finance MEC Mac Jack and former MEC Pauline Williams have been removed.The move angered Luthuli House. The ANC notes with disbelief action of the Northern Cape Premier Comrade Sylvia Lucas to reshuffle her cabinet without any consultation with the ANC yesterday 10 May 2017. We view this as a flagrant abuse of her office to further divide the ANC and undermine unity of the organisation. Her unbridled arrogance is a betrayal of trust with the ANC the organisation that deployed her as premier. We reaffirm the 52nd national conference resolution that consultation with the ANC structures on matters of deployment is a principle of the organisation and not a favour. Our deployees must desist from misusing their deployment to deepen divisions in the ANC the ruling party said in an official statement.
