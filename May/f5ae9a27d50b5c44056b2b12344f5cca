The Coligny Magistrate's Court has heard two versions of how a 17-year-old boy, who was killed allegedly by two men, died.The two accused, Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte, told the court that they were going to plead not guilty.Their version of the story was read out in the form of an affidavit by their legal representatives. They said the boy, Matlhomola "Faki" Mosweu, was stealing sunflowers, they then apprehended him and put him in the back of their bakkie .They said that while driving, the boy jumped out of the moving bakkie. They said they did not stop but drove straight to the police station and reported the case, leaving the boy lying on the ground.The state called Brigadier Matome Kgorane of the Potchefstroom organised crime unit who said one of his witnesses told him that he saw the two accused throwing the boy out of the moving vehicle.He said the witness told him that the two accused took his cellphone and visited his place the following day when they threatened him not to tell the police or any other person of what had happened."They also forced him to drink alcohol and told him to run in front of their bakkie."Coligny town was at a standstill last week after angry residents took to the streets, looting shops and burning property after two men were not arrested after allegedly killing the boy.Kgorane, who opposed bail for the two, said there was a possibility of adding more charges against the accused. He said a charge of kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice might be added.They were initially charged with murder and attempted murder .The accused, through their legal representatives, said they needed to be released on bail because they were having a problem in sharing one public toilet at the holding cells and that they could not bear the smell of dagga and cigarette smoke in the police cells.
