Cavin Johnson is hoping Platinum Stars show an upturn in form in the African confederation Cup this week or face early elimination from the competition.But he and his players are going to have to adjust to a 10pm kick-off when they meet CS Sfaxien of Tunisia away on Sunday.The late kick-off is because of the Muslim month of Ramadan where footballing is now only played after breaking fast at dusk. It s not something we have encouraged before and that is why we are heading to Tunis early to make sure we can have a practice at 10pm and get used to the idea of a very of day he told TimesLive on TuesdayStars are traveling via Dubai on Thursday and will be in Sfax by Friday evening.They have just a single point from their opening two games in Group B and can ill afford another setback and conceding four goals to Mbabane Swallows in their last group game. I thought our youngsters did very well in our first game against the Algerians but I was baffled by the fact we played so well against Kaizer Chiefs thereafter and then lost in Swaziland. The approach of our PSL players to these competitions doesn t make sense to me. Stars travel without the suspended Vuyo Mere and Gift Sithole.South Africa s other representatives in African club competition are also back in action over the weekend with SuperSport United traveling out on Friday to Lubumbashi to meet holders TP Mazembe Englebert. That is the crunch game in Group D where the pair both have four points and share top place in the group.Mamelodi Sundowns produced an inspiring performance last week to revive their African Champions League campaign when they won 3-1 at AS Vita Club in Democratic Republic of Congo after a goalless home draw with St George of Ethiopia in their opening Group C game.On Friday in Atteridgeville Sundowns host Esperance of Tunisia with whom they share top place in the standings.- TMG Digital/TMG Sport
