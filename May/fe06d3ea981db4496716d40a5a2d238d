Desperate to prove that they are not a toothless organisation, Safa have warned Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United that they still plan to prosecute them for not releasing their players to the Fifa Under-20 World Cup on time.Reeve Frosler and Teboho Mokoena missed Amajita's opener against Japan, which SA lost 2-1. The two were released for the last two games as Thabo Senong's team bombed out at the first hurdle.Wits allowed Frosler to fly out only after they won the Absa Premiership while Mokoena first helped SuperSport reach the final of the Nedbank Cup before he was released.Amajita arrived at OR Tambo International Airport early yesterday, with Safa boss, Dennis Mumble, promising that an earlier proclamation sent out by the association in which they promised disciplinary action against the clubs, would be followed through."That case is continuing. The chair of the DC last week said he needed to study this again but we are pursuing this thing. We are not going to let it go now that the competition is over. We want to set a precedent. The league has been supportive but these two clubs have been disappointing when it comes to releasing players."We have to make sure people understand that our rules and the country come first."It's unclear what sanction the teams would face but Safa could order that they be fined or banned from using the players for a certain period.Mumble also said Safa was unhappy about Amajita's first round exit. This could put Senong's employment as Amajita head coach into doubt."We will review to see what we do going forward," he said.
