The boy who won the Little Mr World SA 2017 crown has been stripped of his title after his mother and the pageant organiser got into an ugly spat.Hlukani Maswanganyi, 9, of Ekurhuleni, was stripped of the title he won in February.His mother, Portia Lopes, could not raise R89000 on time to fly with him to the Little Mr World pageant in Turkey earlier this month. The package included air tickets, accommodation, meals and excursions.She then used the sponsored ticket given by the SA ambassador to Turkey to take her son there for a holiday."The ambassador gave me permission to use it for Hlukani's holiday to cheer him up," said Lopes.However, Carolyn Baldwin Botha of Pageants SA, the organiser, said this had inconvenienced her and stripped the boy of the title.She has since demanded that Lopes refund her and return the sash that Hlukani won in SA because she "lacked ethics and morals"."I did take away the title. I run an ethical company that has values and specifically assists those less fortunate. I have had no option but to strip the child of his title ... I cannot work with a title-holder under these extremely unethical and negative conditions," Botha said.Lopez said her child didn't know that he had been stripped of his crown."I won't even bother him. He [has] moved on," said Lopes.After raising some of the fees through donations, including approaching government departments, Botha allegedly refused to have the money paid directly to the competition's main organisers and hotel and insisted that it be transferred via her agent in euros.This was a condition that was also stipulated in the contract. Botha said the reason was that the main pageant organisers did not live in Turkey and that all the monies had to be paid before leaving SA.Payment delays resulted in Hlukani missing the opportunity to participate in the competition in Turkey."Lopes should have from the very beginning offered the tickets to someone who could use them for the reason they were issued in the first place ... Lopes had no intention of attending at all," Botha said.
