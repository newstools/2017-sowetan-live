An EFF councillor wants the North Gauteng High Court to force two Mpumalanga MECs to reverse the unlawful promotion and hiring of nearly 140 Thaba Chweu local municipality employees, including the mayor's bodyguard and assistant.Exodus Mabanne, 37, has asked the court to reverse former acting municipal manager Lesley Mokwena's appointment of 136 employees without a council resolution shortly after the August 3 local government elections.According to his court papers, Mabanne also wants Mpumalanga finance MEC Eric Kholwane and co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Refilwe Mtsweni to institute a skills audit of the municipality's employees.The EFF proportional representation councillor accuses the municipality of approving more than R25.4-million for the salaries of the irregularly promoted and appointed employees in the 2016/2017 financial year and only R2-million for service delivery."[Former] acting municipal manager Lesley Mphaka Mokwena in the absence of the councillors he acted as one (chair) in which he is not obligated to do so by Municipal Systems Act or any local government policies," said Mabanne of the "unconstitutional" meeting in which the decision to appoint the employees was taken.He said even though the 27-member council reversed the unlawful and irrational decision, the 17 ANC councillors suppressed the move.Mabanne's court papers list a number of appointments in which proper procedures were not followed and one employee hired as an accountant responsible for revenue with only a matric certificate.Soon after ANC provincial executive committee member Selina Mashigo-Sekgobela replaced Michael Ncongwane as mayor in July 2015, a records clerk and public liaison officer became the new mayor's secretary and personal assistant respectively. Both have no proof of matric certification, according to documents submitted in court.Some of the alleged irregular appointments challenged by Mabanne date back to Ncongwane's stint as mayor.The troubled municipality has been given disclaimers for the past eight years.Puleng Mapheto, George Mthethwa and Letshela Jonas for the municipality and the MECs' spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment.
