Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said on Thursday he has noted with grave concern a spate of reports about missing people in particular the prevalence of women and children in these reports. I have been receiving complaints from the public from social media and at my office regarding missing young women and children. This is a matter of grave concern to me and requires immediate action and attention he said in a statement. If people are to judge the South African Police Service (SAPS) it would be based on how it protects women and children the most vulnerable persons in society. SAPS Missing Person Bureau must enhance its efforts in finding missing persons. Most important the SAPS must prevent an escalation of the problem Mbalula said.He advised the public that there is no waiting period in reporting missing persons.This was to make investigations into missing persons quicker to resolve. When you suspect your loved one is missing immediately report to your nearest police station with their most recent photograph an investigator will be allocated to your case and an investigation to find the person will immediately kick-start. While acknowledging the usefulness of social media in spreading the message I will stress the importance of reporting to your nearest SAPS Police Station the Minister advised.He reiterated that there should never be no-go zones in South Africa and that the SAPS will enhance its visibility in areas that are considered risky. Free movement is a constitutionally guaranteed right and ours is to protect it Minister Mbalula said.
