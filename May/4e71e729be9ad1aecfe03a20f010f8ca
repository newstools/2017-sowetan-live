Real Madrid secured their place in the Champions League final on Wednesday despite losing 2-1 away to Atletico Madrid in their semi-final second leg.Real s 3-0 win in the first leg proved too much for Atletico to overcome as the reigning European champions progressed 4-2 on aggregate.Early goals from Saul Niguez and Antoine Griezmann, from a penalty, gave Atletico hope but Isco struck just before the break to leave the hosts with too much to do, taking Real through to a final against Juventus in Cardiff on June 3.
