Bidvest Wits may have won the 2016-17 title but the final day of the Absa Premiership on Super Saturday still has the potential to be a nail-biter.THE TOP FIVE PLACESWits play Kaizer Chiefs in their final fixture at FNB Stadium in an unassailable first place where the only interest for the new champions is to win their last game for pride and collect the PSL trophy.Chiefs though need a win to stand a chance of a fourth-placed finish which would be some consolation on a mediocre season. If fifth-placed Amakhosi (47 points) lose they are likely to sag to a worse finish than that of last season in fifth.Second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns still have all to play for. If they lose or draw against relegation-desperate Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium and Cape Town City beat Polokwane City at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium Downs will finish third and not qualify for the 2018 Caf Champions League.African champions Sundowns have 56 points and Cape Town City on 55 will push hard for a second-placed finish that would cap a memorable first season of existence where they also won the Telkom Knockout.SuperSport United (48 points) need a win against 10th-placed Platinum Stars at Lucas Moripe Stadium to preserve fourth position as a reward to outgoing coach Stuart Baxter who is taking the Bafana Bafana head coaching job.THE FIGHT FOR THE TOP EIGHTIn mid-table sixth-placed Polokwane (40 points) are assured a top eight finish.Jostling for the top eight are seventh-placed Maritzburg United (37 points) who host 12-placed Bloemfontein Celtic at Harry Gwala Stadium; and eighth-positioned Ajax Cape Town (36 points) who meet last-placed Baroka FC at Cape Town Stadium.Ninth-placed Golden Arrow (35 points) meet 11th-placed Orlando Pirates (33) who have a highly unlikely chance at the top eight if they win and a lot of results go their way at Moses Mabhida Stadium.Tenth-placed Platinum Stars (34) meeting SuperSport have a slightly better chance.THE RELEGATION BATTLEIt is the fight to avoid relegation the most expensive battle in football that holds the most intrigue and suspense of the final day of the 2016-17 PSL season.Five teams Celtic (12th place 28 points) Chippa United (13th 27) Free State Stars (14th 27) Highlands Park (15th 26) and Baroka (16th 25) are mathematically in contention for the last-placed relegation spot or second-last playoff place.Celtic are the most comfortable and at worst can finish in the playoffs though it is unlikely even if they lose against Maritzburg.Chippa need a point to be safe against Free State Stars at Goble Park. Free State need a win to guarantee safety.Highlands and Baroka are desperate for three points and the teams above them to lose.Given Downs Champions League ambitions against Highlands and Ajax s top eight requirements against Baroka it is conceivable that both the bottom two can lose to remain in their current positions.But this is the final day of the PSL where pressure counts for everything and form for nothing so any predictions would be foolhardy.Saturday (all 3pm):Kaizer Chiefs v Bidvest Wits FNB StadiumAjax Cape Town v Baroka FC Cape Town Stadium SuperSport United v Platinum Stars Lucas Moripe Stadium Lamontville Golden Arrows v Orlando Pirates Moses Mabhida StadiumFree State Stars v Chippa United Goble Park StadiumMaritzburg United v Bloemfontein Celtic Harry Gwala Stadium Polokwane City v Cape Town City Old Peter Mokaba StadiumHighlands Park v Mamelodi Sundowns Makhulong Stadium - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
