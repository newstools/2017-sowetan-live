Despite failing to defend his FNB Cape Town 12 OneRun title at the weekend, Stephen Mokoka, 32, trusts he will have a good year heading towards the Great Manchester Run, a 10km race this weekend, and the IAAF World Championships in August. Finishing sixth for a defending champion may be deemed a flop but Mokoka is convinced that his performance on Sunday will boost his desire to have a great year."It was basically my first race of the season. My season started very badly because of injuries but my body is picking up,'' Mokoka said." I cannot say that I used this [Cape] race to prepare for coming races but I ran very carefully, knowing that I would run again in few days [in Manchester, UK].''With the biennial athletics event in London three months away, the Mahikeng-born runner also wants to stamp his authority at the global championship. Mokoka had a stellar 2016 - he competed at the Rio Olympics in Brazil where he registered his personal best (27:54:57) in the 10000m final. He won the Shanghai International Marathon in China for the fourth time and also won the African Championships title in the 10000m race in Durban.
