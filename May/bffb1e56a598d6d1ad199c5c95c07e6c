Popular dentist "Dr Smile" was busy with a patient when Bukelwa Moerane shared her story about how she was kidnapped in Soweto and jumped out of a moving car, leaving her with injuries and without her two front teeth - ultimately losing her smile.Dr Smile, as Alexander Faizi Rawhani is affectionately known, said his phone was buzzing with hundreds of messages from his social media network profiles and WhatsApp texts."People had read her tweets and were asking me to help her."I did not know what they were talking about. But when I finally saw her, I did not think twice about helping her because this is what I do," said Rawhani.He has now created temporary implants for Moerane to return one of the most precious things in her life - her smile.The 24-year-old from Soweto was kidnapped along the busy Chris Hani Road in Diepkloof while walking to catch a taxi home from Maponya Mall. #MenAreTrash: Karabo Mokoena s death sparks harrowing tales of abuse Rawhani said a smile was "a huge thing in a person's life"."People take a smile for granted but it is a huge thing. It is important for your business, for your impact and your confidence, no matter your age."For me, my whole opinion on life is that we have been given certain talents and abilities for the betterment of humanity and not for our own gain," Rawhani said.He said Moerane's story should be an opportunity for other dentists to realise that they were in a position to help a lot of people."We place too much importance on material things that it is such a big deal when someone is getting something for free," Rawhani said.Moerane said she was blessed and honoured."I am quite honoured to be in good hands such as [those of] Dr Smile. I feel blessed that I am getting help. I never thought that I would get new teeth to start with," Moerane said."I am happy with the progress that has been made. I can see that the doctor is passionate about what he does and he wants a perfect job. I'm impressed with his work and by his love and passion."
