Canadian authorities on Wednesday recalled gin distributed by Bermuda-based Bacardi, after inspectors found the alcohol content was nearly twice the level advertised on the bottle.It is the second time in recent months that a liquor recall was ordered because of a too high alcohol content. In March, hundreds of bottles of Georgia Bay Vodka with a whopping 81% alcohol level were removed from store shelves. Ontario s Liquor Control Board was the first to report the latest incident, asking consumers to return bottles of Bombay Sapphire brand London Dry Gin due to high alcohol content. Four other provinces soon followed, warning Canadians not to consume the gin, sold in 1.14 liter bottles. Consumers were told that their money would be refunded. Bacardi said the affected batch is believed to have been sold only in Canada. According to a statement from the Ontario Liquor Control Board, the problem was traced back to the production line. One batch was bottled before correct dilution to achieve the stated 40% alcohol content by volume. As a result, the affected batch has alcohol content by volume of 77%, it said. No illnesses associated with consumption of the gin have been reported, said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
