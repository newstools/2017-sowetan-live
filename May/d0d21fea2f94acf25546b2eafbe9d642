The national Under-20 coach Thabo Senong believes that the country has a bright future with the growing number of youngsters who are plying their trade abroad. There has been a growing number of youngsters who have been signed by clubs in some of the best leagues in Europe.Some of those players have gone there without having even played that much in the domestic scene.Thabo Cele who signed a five-year contract with Benfica is among those players.Cele travelled to Netherlands with the Amajita squad that included the likes of Portugal-based Liam Jordan and Kabelo Seriba who is based in Latvia.That squad played three friendlies a 1-0 loss to German side VFL Bochum a 2-0 win to a select Amsterdam team and a 2-1 defeat at the hands of PEC Zwolle.Those matches are part of the team s preparation for the Under-20 World Cup in South Korea that runs from May 20 June 11. What is happening with the number of youngsters who are going abroad is just unbelievable Senong said. The Lebo Mothibas (in France) and the Lebogang Phiris (in Denmark)."We have two youngsters in France Keanu Cupido and Tholang Masegela."There is Zama Rambuwane in Israel and Seriba in Latvia among others."This will be good for the country."If you remember when we exported quality youngsters some decades ago we had good players coming to Bafana Bafana."The likes of Aaron Mokoena Steven Pienaar and Benni McCarthy."This Under-20 generation has a good number of players playing abroad."I believe that this is the future of the Under-23 Olympic team and then of course they will gradually go to Bafana."Our future looks bright."Let s nurture and protect these players from social factors that can disturb their progress. Amajita will return to the country on Thursday just before Senong announces the squad to go to the World Cup.That team will go to Korea on Sunday in the final phase of their preparations.In Korea Amajita will play friendlies against Costa Rica Saudi Arabia Ecuador Mexico and hopefully three more games before they start the tournament on May 21 against Japan. Italy and Uruguay complete their group. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
