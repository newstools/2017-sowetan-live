For decades, The Gambia has built a reputation as a haven for tourists willing to pay for sun, sand, sea ... and sex.But its tourism board has ambitious plans to give a makeover to this tiny west African nation known until now to tourists mainly for muscular young men selling themselves on beaches to much older women from Europe.Abdoulie Hydara, director-general of the Gambia Tourism Board, dreams of his nation becoming the next Kenya or Zimbabwe - African countries whose wildlife and nature attract well-heeled visitors from across the globe."We need to develop new products while maintaining and improving what we already have," Hydara told AFP, enthusing about the country's little-known chimpanzee colony and varied bird life.Hydara plans to put The Gambia on the map for ecological and cultural tourism, ending reliance on cheap package tours delivering tourists to beach areas close to the capital.To achieve this, experts and industry insiders say The Gambia must improve infrastructure and deal with its image as a cheap but sometimes seedy destination.The government must also do more to tackle its reputation for lax monitoring, which leaves Gambian children at risk from paedophile tourists, NGOs believe.At 10:00 pm on a Saturday night in the popular Senegambia tourist zone, the idyllic family vacations that Hydara evokes feel a million miles away, lost in a sea of strip lighting and a bevvy of teenagers flirting mechanically with potential punters.On this strip, men, women and children are for sale at a price negotiated via "bumsters", some of them sex workers, others working as pimps. Lamin Sady, 29, who sells shells on the beach during the November-April tourist season, said many of his friends sleep with and in some cases marry, older women, which, he said, was due to their inability to provide for a Gambian wife."They don't have a compound, they don't have a car," he said. The older women "assist them, uplift them, give them a car and help them travel to Europe."Some bumsters are also responsible for arranging child clients for sex tourists, often with the knowledge of the children's parents, said Gambian child protection expert Njundu Drammeh.Drammeh, the national coordinator at The Gambia's Child Protection Alliance, said many parents turned a blind eye to children returning from the beach with large amounts of money, or encouraged "sponsorship" of their child through school with abuse attached.Not a single tourist has been prosecuted for paedophilia in The Gambia, Drammeh said, and no full study has been undertaken on the magnitude of the scourge.But a member of The Gambia's dedicated tourist police, who gave his name only as Lamin as he was not authorised to speak to the media, said it was a problem sadly familiar to the force."Mostly, it is pornography, taking pictures of the private parts of little kids," Lamin said, anger in his voice.The Gambia's image problem is also pressing given that tourist numbers were hit "badly" by the country's political crisis in December and January, according to Hydara.
