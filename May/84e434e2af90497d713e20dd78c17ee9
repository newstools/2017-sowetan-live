Grade one learners at Isiseko Junior Secondary School in Centane Nontshinga village near Kei Mouth kneel on the floor and use chairs as desks because of a lack of furniture.The school was started by parents in 1982 when three rondavels were built by volunteers from the community. In 1991 each household donated R50 to build classrooms. After the three blocks were finished learners were moved to the three classrooms.Three years later parents went back to the drawing-board. This time it was decided that each house would donate R100 to build another three blocks. Since then not a single classroom has been built by the Eastern Cape Department of Education.Teachers and members of the School Governing Body told GroundUp that when they asked the department to build them more classrooms the department built toilets far from the classrooms. The small fence the parents managed to buy only surrounds the six classrooms and a shack used by grade R leaving the toilets outside.Teachers and SGB members said since 2002 the department had told them they were on a waiting list for a new school. But school principal Vusumzi Jaxa said when he phoned the department on 25 April about the delays he was told that was no longer the case. The person made it very clear that there s no new school going to be built here he said.This article was published in GroundUp
