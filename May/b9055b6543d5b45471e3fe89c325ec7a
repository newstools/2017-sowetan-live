An independent forensic investigator assisting the family of Reshall Jimmy who burned to death in his Ford Kuga has urged South Africans to stop buying Ford vehicles due to the appalling manner in which the company has allegedly handled the incident.Jimmy burnt to death in December 2015 in his luxury Ford Kuga SUV while holidaying in the Wilderness in the Western Cape.Dr David Klatzow the forensic scientist the family has roped in to assist with the matter said it was time to put out a message to the buying public to boycott Ford vehicles.Speaking in Pretoria on Wednesday Klatzow said Ford has come up with a string of versions on the cause of Jimmy s death all designed to take the blame away from Ford. Jimmy family accuse Ford SA of using religion and God to try to 'manipulate' them He said first Ford insisted the fire started at the back of the vehicle despite expert reports that the fire started at the front passenger side of the dashboard and now Ford was claiming that Jimmy died from a bullet wound to the head and that he committed suicide despite post-mortem results proving that he was killed by the fire. I think it is time to put out the message to the general purchasing public of SA along the following lines: that I would not buy a Ford vehicle under any circumstances. Not because their vehicles are inherently bad but if you do end up with some kind of terrible problem this is the indication of the way the company will treat you. That is to avoid you at all costs Klatzow said.The Times has reported how Ford SA had turned to God in a move the family see as a bid to silence them with Nemeth requesting a meeting with Jimmy s sister Renisha and her ailing mother Polly overseen by Anglican Archbishop Thabo Makgoba held in Johannesburg on Friday.Instead the family said the meeting left Reshall s mother distraught and traumatised by accusations that Jimmy was murdered and that the company was not responsible for his death.Renisha said they wanted Ford to take responsibility for her brother s horrific death and apologise to the family for the murder and suicide claims. To me responsibility is key to apologise to the family and say we are sorry for everything we have done to your family. My mom had a breakdown after that meeting she said.Ford is not commenting on the matter with spokesperson Rella Bernades saying they recognised how devastating the loss has been on Jimmy s family but said given the sensitivity and unique circumstances of the case they had nothing to add on this matter at this time.
