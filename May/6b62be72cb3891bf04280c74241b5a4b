"We didn't know the boyfriend but we saw him coming to fetch her. He drove a gold BMW, that she [Karabo] would sometimes drive."She became very estranged when she started living in Sandton, which was around 2014/2015. She would first visit [there] but it became more permanent then."Karabo's uncle said her parents, Agnes and Thabang Mokoena, were traumatised by her death."It was a very traumatic experience. We couldn't see her with our eyes, we only saw the pictures."He said there was a tyre around her and it seemed the body was doused with petrol and set alight.The family went to identify her charred remains yesterday.Police have confirmed that a man believed to be Karabo's boyfriend, a 27-year-old entrepreneur, was arrested on Wednesday night and would appear in court today."Yesterday we were here [at the Sandton police station] until around 4am," Mokoena said yesterday."The police went where the gentleman is staying. This is where they saw the footage that she entered on the 28th of April but never came out."The gentleman was seen [in the footage} exiting and coming back with a Pikitup bin."Philanthropist Matthew Mensah said Karabo had visited him and they were working on starting a foundation for abused girls."When I met her she looked vulnerable and told me she wanted to help younger girls and just to have peace," said Mensah.
