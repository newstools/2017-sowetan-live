The figure at the centre of the Sascoc sexual harassment row, chief executive Tubby Reddy, says he'll prove that the claims made by a female staff member at the Olympic governing body is an orchestrated move.Reddy told a weekend newspaper that he was the target of a move to oust him, accusing SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) president Gideon Sam of being behind the plot."How could I when I have been working with the man for so many years?" Sam asked."This is an internal matter and we have recommended an independent panel to hear both individuals. Both can bring their lawyers. It is a labour matter, it's got nothing to do with the board," Sam added.Reddy, however, said he would stand his ground before an investigating panel to clear his name."This is not new and I can prove that this has been orchestrated. I have not been charged and I don't have any of the so-called annexures," Reddy said.This referred to an email dated April 21 addressed to Sam wherein the employee claimed Reddy had victimised her, hindered her from performing her job and made threats to her job security, among other allegations in the six-page document.Reddy said the matter has been escalated to the office of Sport Minister Thulas Nxesi."They [Sascoc board] said they'll look at it happening soon," said Reddy, adding that he was was still reporting for duty at Olympic House.The sexual misconduct saga took a dramatic twist on Monday when an email purporting to be an apology from Reddy's accuser, was sent to the media. It was followed a few minutes later by a claim from the accuser that her email account had been hacked. All this unfolded on the day Sascoc was holding a board meeting to discuss the composition of its executive."It was a normal board meeting. The sexual harassment claim was one of the items. We dismissed it because there's no substance," said Sam.
