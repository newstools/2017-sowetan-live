Mamelodi Sundowns have made amends for their poor start in the CAF Champions League by beating AS Vita Club 3-1 Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa yesterday.The reigning champions kicked off their group campaign with a disappointing goalless draw at home against Ethiopian side Saint George two weeks ago.Sundowns bounced back with a convincing victory against AS Vita, with goals from Anthony Laffor, Yannick Zakri and Sibusiso Vilakazi putting them top of Group C with four points.The Tshwane side looked good even without their captain Hlompho Kekana (thigh strain), Tiyani Mabunda (ankle injury) and Khama Billiat, who is also nursing an ankle injury.Pitso Mosimane's boys missed some good chances especially in the first half, but more than made up for it in the second half.Ivorian forward Zakri had a chance to give Sundowns an early lead after receiving a defence splitting pass from Percy Tau and forced his way past the defenders, but failed to beat goalkeeper Nelson Lukong from close range.The Tshwane side took the lead midway through the first half when Laffor sneaked through at the far post to head home after a pinpoint cross by Tebogo Langerman.Sundowns' joy was shortlived, though. Vita pulled one back with a long range strike by Oumar Sidibe, beating Denis Onyango who reacted a bit late.Tau then had a penalty appeal turned down before Zakri rattled the crossbar just before the break.It was all Sundowns in the second half as they played some great attacking football.Zakri made up for his first half miss when he blasted home from outside the box to restore Sundowns' lead.Themba Zwane could have ended this as a contest in the 66th minute, but failed to beat the keeper one-on-one after a pass by Tau.Despite Vita trying their best to get an equaliser, Sundowns had the last say as Vilakazi shook off his marker to slot home with 13 minutes to go. In the other Group C match, Tunisia's Esperance and St George played to a goalless draw. This means Esperance are joint top with Downs, with identical goal difference after they too beat Vita 3-1 in Tunis on May 12.
