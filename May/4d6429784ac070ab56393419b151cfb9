The ankle injury that Khama Billiat suffered against Maritzburg United last week has not recovered sufficiently and he will be missing when Mamelodi Sundowns line up against AS Vita Club of the Democratic Republic of Congo in Kinshasa on Wednesday.Billiat had to be taken off during the Premier Soccer League match after some robust tackling and his loss in a key game for Pitso Mosimane s men is likely to be keenly felt.But Leonardo Castro is back after returning from Colombia and is available for the African Champions League grudge game.He had traveled home to take his pregnant wife back where she is expected to give birth to the couple s child in the coming weeks.Castro has had limited game time this season after initially struggling with injury but did feature in the Champions League last year.Sundowns must avoid defeat otherwise will find themselves sitting at the bottom of their group standings after two games.The defending champions made a poor start to the group phase when newcomers St George from Ethiopia held them to a draw at Atteridgeville 10 days ago.But AS Vita Club were beaten at the same time by Esperance of Tunisia and are also keenly chasing points.It is the second meeting in as many years between Vita and Sundowns after the Congolese edged Sundowns on the away goal rule last year to qualify for the group stage only to be disqualified for using a defaulter in the earlier rounds.Sundowns were restored to the competition in their place and famously went on to win the continental crown.Sundowns will be well aware of what they face on an artificial pitch at the cavernous Stade des Martys in the Congolese capital.On Tuesday St George and Esperance drew 0-0 in Addis Ababa so Esperance have four points and St George two. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
