The runners who finished in the top three in the opening Spar Women's 10 km Challenge earned bonus points for finishing below the target time set for the race.Louisa Leballo, Kesa Moletsane and Irvette van Zyl took the podium in Cape Town.The target time for tomorrow's race in Port Elizabeth is 33.26 minutes, which is within the capabilities of the top three or four runners and if the weather is good, the pace should be fast and competition fierce.The trio have not allowed the grass to grow under their feet since the Spar race on April 2.Moletsane won the 5000m at the SA championships in Potchefstroom, using her powerful kick to clinch the title. Van Zyl was second and Nolene Conrad, who finished seventh in Cape Town, was third.Moletsane followed up by winning the 5 000m at the SA Student Championships in Cape Town last weekend.
