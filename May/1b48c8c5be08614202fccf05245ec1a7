A North West family feud reached tragic proportions through what appears to be a revenge killing for the death of one of the relatives.Okame Sedietso, 36, from Tlapeng village near Morokweng, was burnt to death after his mother was accused of being involved in the disappearance of his uncle.It is alleged that Sedietso's mother, Onalenna, was accused by her relatives of being involved in the 47-year-old man's disappearance early this month. The missing man was last seen on May 2 after visiting Onalenna.His car was found burnt in the bushes a few days later but he could not be traced. His family believed that he may have been burnt beyond recognition in the car. The man's family allegedly consulted a sangoma who claimed Onalenna knew of his whereabouts.Angry family members then allegedly went to Onalenna's home where they tied Okame with wire, poured petrol on him and set him alight.Sedietso's brother Okametse said he had given police a statement before he died on Sunday.The distraught Onalenna said she could not believe her son died because of an allegation by a sangoma."He (the missing man) is my cousin. We were close. I would not do anything to harm him. Now they've killed my son because they think I had something to do with his disappearance. It's insane," she said.The missing man's family, however, did not want to comment on Sedietso's death.When asked if they indeed visited a sangoma one of the family members pleaded ignorance. The Sedietso family said they now lived in fear of further attacks against them.Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said a case of murder had been opened after Sedietso's death.
