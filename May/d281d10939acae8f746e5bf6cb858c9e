If you think scoring 17 goals in the National First Division this season was enough to cap off Siyabonga "Bhele" Nomvethe's colourful career, think again because the veteran AmaZulu striker is not hanging up his boots anytime soon.If you think scoring 17 goals in the National First Division this season was enough to cap off Siyabonga "Bhele" Nomvethe's colourful career, think again because the veteran AmaZulu striker is not hanging up his boots anytime soon.When it comes to individual accolades, Nomvethe is arguably one of the most decorated players in South Africa. In 2012 at the age of 34 while playing for Moroka Swallows, he won the PSL Footballer of the Year, Absa Player of the Season, Players' Player of the Season and the Golden Boot with 19 goals.In a season where we have seen some of the best international footballers like Roma's Francesco Totti and the Bayern Munich duo of Xabi Alonso and Philipp Lahm retiring, it would not be a surprise to see Nomvethe, who turns 40 in December, follow suit. But the Durban-born striker is soldiering on and still feels "fresh"."It is a God-given talent [to play many years]. I cannot just retire because I see people doing it. My body is still allowing me to continue. I am feeling fresh and young. You can see that I am still the same player as I was 23 years old, so why would I retire? I can still play five years or more from now,'' Nomvethe told Sowetan yesterday.While his contract with Usuthu expires in July, "Bhele" is optimistic that he will still be with the KwaZulu-Natal outfit in their bid to gain promotion next season."My contract is expiring at the end of July, but I am staying with the club because I promised myself that I will take the club back to the Absa Premiership. We have not agreed on the new deal yet but I would like to stay with AmaZulu for more years because I love the club and it is my hometown's team," added the ex-Kaizer Chiefs marksman.
