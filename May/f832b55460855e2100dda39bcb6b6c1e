President Jacob Zuma has in his arsenal tried-and-tested methods of getting rid of his opponents in the ANC and the state.Fake intelligence reports are one such example.The president's latest victims were Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas, both fired from cabinet.Zuma used an intelligence report that even his own intelligence minister, David Mahlobo, allegedly knew nothing about it.Mahlobo went public, saying anyone with the report should report to him, exposing Zuma.The use of intelligence reports is not new and many, like Gordhan and Jonas, lost their jobs without the allegations in these reports being tested in courts of law or them appearing before disciplinary processes to defend themselves.Zuma fired former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, who was replaced with Gordhan, without giving reasons for doing so.Nene's firing took place soon after a so-called intelligence report titled Project Spider Web surfaced.It contained allegations that under Nene, National Treasury had been captured by white business and also that apartheid-era intelligence operatives were controlling South Africa's finances.At the SA Revenue Service, Gordhan, Ivan Pillay and Oupa Magashula were charged with fraud by the National Prosecuting Authority over a so-called rogue unit.But charges were subsequently withdrawn.In the ANC and Cosatu, intelligence reports smeared leaders without presenting proof of the allegations contained in the reports.The report, titled simply Source Reports, led to Zwelinzima Vavi being suspended at Cosatu.At the time there was a big fallout between Vavi and Zuma.The president's supporter, Cosatu president S'dumo Dlamini, was allegedly the one who distributed the fake report to other leaders in the federation.The report alleged that leaders including Vavi, Tokyo Sexwale, Julius Malema and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa were part of an American think-tank, the National Endowment for Democracy, supposedly aiming to establish a "United States of America in Africa" by infiltrating and overthrowing governments.The Scorpions were disbanded over the so-called spy tapes and the Hawks unit was established.Zuma is the president of the country and no longer the spy master. The country cannot afford Zuma's use of smoke and mirrors to destroy his opponents.The reports have never been probed and it is high time that any use of shady reports is justified by verifiable evidence - evidence that can be tested in a court of law.In plain English, it has to be the truth.Until now, most of the reports have presented "findings" far from the truth - and the president has entertained and used these lies.Now a court has ruled in favour of the DA demanding that Zuma provide reasons for firing Gordhan and Jonas.The crisis Zuma is facing comes from the fact that Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize have already said that the fake intelligence report was used to fire the pair.Zuma also told the SACP the fake report was used to fire Gordhan and Jonas.Be careful Mr President, the use of fake reports could see you being accused of sabotaging the country.
