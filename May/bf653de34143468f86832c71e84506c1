Bafana Bafana do not need to go to Nigeria trying to play for a win. They need to sneak in commit a burglary and make a run for it with a draw with anything more a bonus.Stuart Baxter has already identified Itumeleng Khune at goalkeeper and Dean Furman in midfield as the kind of battlers he needs for trench warfare in Nigeria.The new Bafana coach names his squad on Thursday for the opening match of South Africa s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign on June 10 in Uyo.South Africa have still never beaten their nemesis Super Eagles in a competitive match let alone away though Bafana did hold a 2-0 lead against Nigeria in Uyo in 2014 before late goals saw the game end 2-2 a result that saw Shakes Mashaba s men qualify for the 2015 Afcon at the defending champions expense.So any result will do especially in Baxter s first game in charge.Times Media Digital has identified five players Baxter needs in his briefcase on the plane to Nigeria who can perform just such a smash-and-grab job:* Thulani Hlatshwayo Hlatshwayo has just been the stalwart in defence who played such a key role in Bidvest Wits winning their first league title in 96 years. Tyson is one of the few South Africans who can stand toe-to-toe with the big Nigerians matching earth-shattering challenge for challenge.* Sifiso Hlanti If Baxter is looking for battlers and physical presence he needs not look further than another of Wits key title winners.And Hlanti can get forward on the overlap too. Mamelodi Sundowns Tebogo is a better attacker from left-back but Hlanti is defensively stronger which is what will be needed in Uyo.* Hlompo Kekana Kekana can notch so many midfield battles won around the continent now for Sundowns becoming African club champions last year he s running out of space on his bedpost.Big strong in the challenge and completely unafraid 'KK' is the midfield warrior Baxter needs in the centre of the park.* Bongani Zungu Zungu might seem a little on the stylish and skilful side for the job at hand but he s made his breakthrough and been in the sort of form that has made him the player his team-mates give the ball to at Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal.And he s big and strong for a playmaker does also play deep in central midfield and can get involved in the physical exchanges.Defence starts from the front and Zungu can both create and defend from playmaker deployed in front of Furman and Kekana in deeper roles.* Tokelo Rantie He s reminded of his ability with wonder goal this past weekend for Gen lerbirli i against B y ksehir.Rantie might not have found consistency in Turkey with just two goals in 18 starts but his pace outstripping defences is always a destructive weapon even if he lacks a finish.More importantly Rantie was the star player in last 2-2 draw in Uyo scoring a brace either side of the break that almost earned Bafana a famous win. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
