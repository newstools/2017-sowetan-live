I think it was her way of finding healing from the things she had gone through her friend Matthew Mensah told TimesLive. She was very committed and dedicated because you sometimes find people who say they are interested but never follow through said Mensah.Karabo had told him about how she found herself in an abusive relationship in the past. She said she had been through a lot of things and you could hear in her voice that whatever it was was serious said Mensah.This had spurred Karabo to start planning the launch of her own non-governmental organisation to assist abused women.But on Thursday morning after almost two weeks since she was last seen her father announced that she had been found dead. The boyfriend confessed. He killed and burned my daughter Tshepo Mokoena Karabo s father wrote on Facebook.Mokoena was reported to have gone missing on April 28.Mensah said they were meant to have headed to the women s shelter on that day but she stopped replying to his text messages.The Frida Hartley Shelter for destitute women and children in Hillbrow which Karabo frequented took to Instagram to honour her.
