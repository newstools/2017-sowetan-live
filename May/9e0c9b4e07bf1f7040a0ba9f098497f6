Highlands Park director Sinky Mnisi says they do not regret letting coach Alan Freese go in October."People will always say it is either too early or too late to release a coach but the bottom line is that a coach is released at any time for as long as things are not going well," Mnisi told Sowetan yesterday, following the sacking of Gordon Igesund after the team plunged to a 2-0 loss to SuperSport United at Makhulong Stadium on Friday evening.Mnisi said Les Grobler, who was Freese's assistant, had been appointed to guide the team in their remaining four matches - against Platinum Stars, Chippa United, Baroka and Mamelodi Sundowns.He will be assisted by Thierry Mulonzo who was Igesund's deputy."Freese laid a solid foundation for the club and we respect him for that, while Gordon did a lot for us and we will always have a soft spot for him."The board of directors took a decision on Saturday after realising that desired results were not coming. It seems that players are not responding to his methods," said Mnisi.Freese was in charge of the Tembisa-based club for seven Absa Premiership fixtures before he was redeployed to the club's youth division, a position he turned down.But Mnisi is adamant that the caretaker coaches will rescue the sinking Highlands ship."Grobler and Mulonzo know our set up very well. Believe me, we are not scared of the situation on the log because one victory in one our remaining games will change our position," Mnisi said."That is how close the gap is in terms of points from No 10 down to 16."Highlands's loss to United saw them return to the bottom.
