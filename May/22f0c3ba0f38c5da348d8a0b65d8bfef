Just when Orlando Pirates supporters were celebrating their club's feat of reaching the Nedbank Cup final, the Buccaneers are faced with inactivity challenge heading to next month's clash against SuperSport United.Unlike SuperSport - who are involved in the CAF Confederation Cup group stages - Pirates will probably have to rely on friendly matches to keep fit for the final at Moses Mabhida Stadium , Durban, on June 24.Pirates, who finish their Absa Premiership campaign on Saturday, away to Golden Arrows, won't have competitive matches to play before the cup final. SuperSport, on the other hand, will play DRC giants TP Mazembe twice after their final Premiership tie against Platinum Stars on Saturday.Bucs beat Arrows 1-0 in Durban on Sunday to reach the final, than ks to an Abbubaker Mobara goal. Pirates have an opportunity to end a disastrous season on a high, as well as settle a score against a SuperSport side that beat them in last year's Ke Yona final in Polokwane. Players such as Mobara, Jackson Mabokgwane and Marc van Heerden will get to play their first knockout competition final with Pirates. Mabokgwane has been the man Jonevret has been going with in goal lately."We know that it will be a tough game [against] SuperSport. Let us enjoy this moment, it has been a troubled season," said Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret."I can understand that a lot of supporters and people around the club are disappointed, but I hope this will help us."There's a big chance that the 11th-placed Soweto giants will finish outside the top eight for the first time in PSL history.Even if they beat Arrows, they have to hope Ajax Cape Town and Platinum Stars do not win their matches.
