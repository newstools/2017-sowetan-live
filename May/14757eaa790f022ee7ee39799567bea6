Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela is cautious in his prognosis as to whether the team will be fierce in the transfer market in the off-season though he admitted Amakhosi are thin in certain areas .Chiefs managed a fourth-placed finish in the Absa Premiership in the 2016-17 season with their 1-0 win against already-crowned champions Bidvest Wits at FNB Stadium on Saturday improving on last season s fifth by a position.Komphela endured a second season without a trophy at Amakhosi.Asked what he will do differently to ensure an improvement in his third season and if it can be expected that Chiefs will be fierce in the market the coach replied: You want to lead me now or mislead me into responding. So I ve got to be very careful. We have to do an audit. And there are areas where I felt we were a bit thin."And there are certain things that I think as a team if we were to rectify the mistakes of this season need to be done. That can be done after we ve done the audit."But clearly there are quite a few things that we need to rectify. In relation to the market that talks to that."Coaches have to be very careful that you don t start saying things before they are done lest there is a different outcome and then you have put everybody in the system under pressure. So one has to be very careful that yes we need to rectify certain things and there are certain areas where we are thin as I said."Without sending a message that We need to buy this player and this player . But we do need to tighten up the screws so that we can come through. Chiefs' chairman Kaizer Motaung who has appeared to give his backing to Komphela saying he believed 2016-17 held more promise than the previous season has said he believes the club need to sign players in their defence. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
