Former Johannesburg ANC Youth League Johannesburg leader Patrick Wisani s behaviour when he assaulted his girlfriend indicates that he was driven by rage the Johannesburg High Court has found.Wisani was on Thursday sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by the Johannesburg High Court for the murder of his girlfriend.He was found guilty in November of beating Nosipho Mandleleni to death with a sjambok and broomstick in the room they shared in Yeoville Johannesburg in September 2015.He also faced charges of allegedly assaulting his late partner s twin sister Siphokazi and her friend in May 2016 in an apparent attempt to intimidate Siphokazi into not testifying against him.Judge Mohamed Ismail sentenced Wisani to 20 years imprisonment for murder and a year each for intimidation and assault. The sentences will run concurrently. The manner in which the deceased was beaten indicates that he [Wisani] was propelled by anger. The deceased s death was not instantaneous. It was a painful and agonising slow death said Ismail.He found that Wisani had not shown any remorse and was arrogant. His behaviour shows disdain towards women. It has no place in our constitutional dispensation. Ismail said he had considered that Wisani was a first-time offender and he is capable of being rehabilitated.
