A struggling rural Eastern Cape municipality has been slammed for banning stick-fighting, singing, ringing bells, blowing horns, striking gongs and playing musical instruments in public.The Mbizana local municipality recently announced the ban as part of its new noise abatement and nuisance prevention by-laws.It has also outlawed using abusive and threatening language in public. Stick-fighting, singing and carrying sticks are common among residents of rural Mpondoland, which falls under Mbizana municipality.National House of Traditional Leaders deputy chairman, Chief Sipho Mahlangu, described the move as an extremely serious injustice in post-apartheid South Africa."Even apartheid didn't go that far when it tried to destroy our culture," Mahlangu said.He warned the municipality against efforts to silence African culture, saying: "No one will be able to do that through the stroke of a pen."He said stick-fighting was part of the indigenous games and traditional leaders were pushing to have it return as an Olympic sport.Residents who break the by-laws face fines or six-months imprisonment, or both.They will also be at risk of more fines and 10 days imprisonment if they continue to contravene the by-laws.The banned conduct and behaviour includes "disturbing the public peace in any street or public place by making unseemly noises or by shouting, insistent hooting, wrangling or quarrelling, or by collecting a crowd or by organising any demonstration or by fighting or challenging to fight, or by striking with or brandishing or using in a threatening manner any stick or other weapon".Any other riotous, violent or unseemly behaviour at any time of the day or night, or by loitering in any street or public place or by gathering in crowds on pavements is also outlawed.Use of a loudspeaker or similar device or by insistent shouting to advertise wares or services in any street or public place is also not allowed.Striking of gongs, blowing of horns or ringing of bells in such manner as to constitute a public nuisance in the neighbourhood is outlawed.Mbizana municipal manager Luvuyo Mahlaka said he would only be able to respond to Sowetan' questions today.Research and advocacy group Good Governance Africa named Mbizana, the birthplace of late ANC president Oliver Tambo, as the worst-performing municipality in its Government Performance Index last year.
