Changing leaders in the ANC will only give corruption a new face and a new name says Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane.Addressing a public meeting in Qwa-Qwa in the Free State Maimane said it would not be possible to build a South Africa if people still believed that the ANC could change. We can t do it if you re still waiting for the ANC to get better to kick out Jacob Zuma and to put someone else in his place. Because this will make no difference to a party for which corruption is the only way to operate. Changing leaders at the top will only give corruption a new face and a new name. The only way to get rid of corruption and put the people first is through a new government Maimane said.
