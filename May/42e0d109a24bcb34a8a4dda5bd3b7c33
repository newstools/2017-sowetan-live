South Africa were made to rue several missed chances in their opening Group D match of the 2017 FIFA U20 World Cup in South Korea after allowing Japan to come back from behind and eventually lose 2-1 at the Suwon Stadium on Sunday.The South Africans scored the opener in the first half after a good long ball from anchor-man Thabo Cele was well controlled by Grant Margeman who made no mistake with a powerful effort to give Amajita the lead. Amajita need to express themselves to beat Japan says coach Senong The Japanese came back strongly in the second half and were duly rewarded in the 47th minute after Ogawa s clever back heel from a low cross trickled over the line following an attempted save by Mondli Mpoto.The goal proved to be the turning point for the Asian champions as Thabo Senong s men lost control of the match allowing Japan to dictate play for the better part of the opening 20 minutes of the second half. Amajita bank on Mukumela's experience The winning goal eventually came in the 65th minute for the Japanese thanks to Ritsu Duon s clinical finish after a good build up that caught the South Africans off guard. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
