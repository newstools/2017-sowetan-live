The wife of a Turkish businessman detained in Malaysia for alleged terrorism offences made a tearful appeal to the government yesterday to release him, saying he is innocent."I am begging the Malaysian government and police not to deport him," Ainnurul Aisyah Yunos said.Her husband Ihsan Aslan was arrested together with another Turkish national last week under a security law which allows detention without trial for 28 days.Malaysia's deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said anti-terrorism police had been investigating the two men, along with others, for "spreading, influencing and funding" activities by the Islamic State group.But rights groups fear Malaysia may be responding to pressure from Turkey, which has mounted a huge crackdown on perceived opponents since a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last year."This is a huge misunderstanding. He is not guilty. .," said Aisyah, who is Malaysian. The 35-year-old was with her three young children at a news conference.Two days after the men's arrest, Turkish academic Ismet Ozcelik was also detained. Turkey's state-run news agency has said the three men were linked to US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen, accused of organising the coup attempt.Aisyah denied her husband had any questionable links. She said her husband "has always been loyal to the lawful government of Turkey and has never been involved in any illegal activity threatening the democracy of Turkey or Malaysia."Erdogan's government has detained tens of thousands under a state of emergency.The UN Human Rights Office for South-East Asia expressed serious concern about the arrests and urged Malaysia to refrain from deporting the men to Turkey.
