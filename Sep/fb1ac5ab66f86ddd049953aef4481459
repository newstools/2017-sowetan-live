Thabo Sithole, starting point guard for the SA men's national basketball team, is determined to put in his best performances against NBA-calibre players at the Fiba AfroBasket tournament.The best African players from around the world will take part in the showpiece event in Senegal and Tunisia starting today (6.30pm)."I feel anxious to play against NBA players in the competition."As a team we are pumped up and raring to go," said the 22-year-old Sithole ahead of SA's opener against Senegal this evening in Dakar."It is going to be tough because it is basketball at the highest level. Some of these guys I have played against at various camps and competitions in the US."The University of KwaZulu-Natal geographical management student is not intimidated by playing Africa's best but is disappointed that the team had a short time to prepare.They were in camp for two weeks before the tournament."Our basketball association should have done more to provide us with the resources for our preparation," Sithole said. "Other teams will have been together for months while we only had 15 days."While most of their opponents are professional basketball players, the semi-professional South Africans will have to punch above their weight.
