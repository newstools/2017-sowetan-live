A detective from Mthatha in the Eastern Cape spent the weekend behind bars after he was arrested for allegedly giving his firearm to two "Nigerian priests" who had promised they would then pray for him.The bizarre incident happened in front of Port Elizabeth's Grand Hotel in Central at about 3pm on Friday.Warrant officer Mninawe Nqunqa, 36, who was arrested, is based at Madeira detective branch in Mthatha.Police spokesman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the detective originally claimed to have been robbed but after interrogation admitted to giving them his firearm, cellphone and wallet."Video footage outside the hotel revealed that the police officer had met with the two men who got into his vehicle."On further probing it became clear the officer had lied and he had voluntarily handed over his firearm, money and cellphone."He alleged that he had met with the men earlier in the day as he wanted them to pray for his misfortunes," Naidu added.The deal took place inside a police Ford Ranger, which was impounded for forensics to assist with identifying the suspects.Nqunqa will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court today on charges of theft and negligent loss of a firearm.Additional charges such as theft of state property, corruption and misuse of a state vehicle - with which he drove to Port Elizabeth - could be added at a later stage."At this stage the suspect claims to have been in Port Elizabeth to attend a court proceeding."He, however, cannot produce any documents stating this. During the course of the investigation, detectives will determine if he was here for court," Naidu added.Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said corruption would not be tolerated."Our Back to Basics approach to policing focuses on every member of the SAPS conducting themselves with integrity and professionalism."It is in the interest of society that we expose and root out corrupt elements within the province through zero tolerance to corruption."Last week it was revealed by safety and liaison MEC Weziwe Tikana that 297 Eastern Cape police firearms went missing or were stolen over the past three years.
