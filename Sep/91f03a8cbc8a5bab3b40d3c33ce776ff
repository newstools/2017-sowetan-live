An unemployed Soweto man believes that former national lottery operator Gidani owes him R80-million for using his concept without compensation.Moitheri Motsoatsoe, 51, from Braamfischer, Soweto, claimed he's the brains behind the idea of playing the lottery via mobile phones.The father of one said he presented his idea to Gidani in October 2007 and entered into a verbal agreement with the company.Gidani, which ran the lottery between October 2007 and May 2015, denied using Motsoatsoe's "unsolicited" concept.The company's head of legal and compliance Dawid Muller said it "had already acquired the ability to provide such services from its technology partner and that the system was proposed to government in 2006, before the submission of the Motsoatsoe concept".Muller said Gidani had, however, gone to "considerable lengths" to accommodate Motsoatsoe but "his continued and inconsistent actions, his disappearance from time to time have made it impossible to conclude the matter".Motsoatsoe was granted permission by the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria to proceed with his R80-million damages claim against Gidani in June 2013.Judge Billy Mothle said in the nine-page judgment that the absence of a written agreement did not necessarily invalidate the existence of an agreement."I'm unable to determine exactly what was agreed upon by the parties, as this was an oral agreement, the precise express or implied terms thereof may only be established through evidence," read the judgment.Motsoatsoe said being unable to afford a lawyer had delayed him justice."I don't have money but with God's grace I will succeed. I'm not going to give up on this matter," Motsoatsoe said.Muller, however, said that during 2007, Gidani had received up to "114 unsolicited proposals" regarding playing the lottery games via the short message system (SMS).Motsoatsoe is armed with dozens of documents including correspondence between himself and Gidani, which detail his 10-year battle for justice.Sowetan has seen correspondence between Motsoatsoe and a legal firm representing Gidani in which a "pre-trial conference" was proposed.Muller confirmed the arrangement, but, however, said: "The first conference was scheduled for November 26, 2014, but Motsoatsoe's legal team notified Gidani a few days before that they were not available for that date."He said another conference was arranged in January 2015 but they did not show up for the meeting."As it can be seen Gidani has gone to considerable lengths to accommodate Motsoatsoe but his continued actions made it impossible to assist him," Muller said.Muller accused Motsoatsoe of "inexplicably turning away" from court in January 2015.He said Motsoatsoe was attempting to "procure compensation for a concept not registered and not clearly patentable because it is not novel, innovative or unique".
