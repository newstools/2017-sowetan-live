Kenya's opposition leader Raila Odinga said on Sunday that his coalition will not share power, two days after the Supreme Court voided last month's presidential election and ordered a new poll within 60 days."We will not share power," Odinga, speaking in Kiswhali outside a church in Nairobi, said. "We will not divide the loaf," a well-known local reference to power.He also repeated his statement after Friday's court ruling that the opposition would not participate in the re-run of the election without changes to the election commission. On Friday he called for the commission to resign and face criminal prosecution.
