Yoann Huget isn't ready to write the Springboks off just yet. Despite their lamentable record of eight defeats from 12 Tests last year he has first hand knowledge of what it's like to be down and out battered and bruised.France's winger cum fullback suffered a catastrophic near career ending injury in the last Rugby World Cup but he insists where there is belief and dedication fortunes can be turned around.Mentally the 30-year old had to dig deep after suffering a knee injury in France's opening match against Italy in 2015. It was very difficult. It required that I take some time off. An entire year in fact to get back. Things are a lot better now. Now I have a good feeling the bearded player said with a smile.He believes the Springboks can also find themselves in a better space before long. They may be vulnerable after last season's disappointments but it also means like a caged beast they can convulse unpredictably. It could be a very dangerous team said Huget. They are not that used to losing so many matches. We don't want to dwell on what they might bring too much. It is not so much what the Boks are doing but the focus is rather on ourselves. He noted that the Springboks had made some changes in personnel which means they may be a different proposition than a year ago. They have had a lot of staff changes and changes in defence and attack. We have to adapt our game regardless. In the northern hemisphere there is a difference in the way we ruck and maul. The game is also a lot faster in Super Rugby. The challenge awaiting us here is a lot different than what we are used to in the Six Nations. This is a tour in the Six Nations nobody wants to finish last said the Toulouse player. It has been a long season and it has been a little bit difficult which makes this a good challenge to come to South Africa. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
