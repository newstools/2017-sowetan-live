Eastern Cape boxing promoter Ayanda Matiti has prepared a 10-bout tournament as part of the June 16 commemorations.Matiti will stage his fights at Turffontein Racecourse, south of Johannesburg, on Friday evening."This tournament will form part of the celebrations for the historic day," said the boss of Xaba Promotions and Events.Topping the bill will be ring veteran Mzonke "The Rose of Khayelitsha" Fana.The 43-year-old two-time IBF junior lightweight holder will bid for the first defence of his SA lightweight title against No 2 contender Thompson Mokwana from Limpopo.Mokwana, 28, will be attempting to reclaim the belt he lost in his third defence to Viwe Mdletyeni in 2012.Fana returns to action following his points loss to Howik Babraham in Germany in March - Fana's 12th defeat against 38 wins.Mokwana - who last fought in August when he lost to Paulos Moses in a WBO Africa title fight in Windhoek - has won 21 of his 34 fights.Fana knows too well that defeat could signal the end of his illustrious career while that same result to Mokwana will reduce him to being a permanent undercard stepping stone.Matiti has included Vladyslav Sirenko, 22, in his bill.The heavyweight Ukrainian, who is trained by SA-based American James Ali Bashir, made a positive debut in Durban in May when he knocked Emmanuel Mnengi out in the first round. Sirenko will face Pete Kapete from Congo.Talented super middleweight Renson "The Limpopo Express" Hobyane will entertain SA-based Nigerian Christian Okeke.There will be eight other bouts.
