Gigaba will sort out our currency"@MrPhamodi tweeted: Our favourite creatively bankrupt douchebro, @zapiro, still resorting to same rape metaphor, only now peppered with a dash of homoantagonism."In response to questions by SowetanLIVE, Shapiro simply said: "Tough times call for tough cartoons."Shapiro has met with a lot of criticism for using rape metaphor's in his cartoons.The Women s Legal Centre as well as people on social media expressed shock at a cartoon where he depicted President Jacob Zuma handing a rape victim draped in the South African flag to one of the Gupta brothers.At the time, Shapiro said that he like so many other artists had become desperate to find ways to make a strong statement about the current situation in the country.- Additional reporting by TMG Digital.
