Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was upset after his side went down 2-1 to Esperance, and the situation was exacerbated by a technical member from the opposition."Jingles" said Sundowns shouldn't have lost the CAF Champions League tie at Lucas Moripe Stadium last Friday, considering the Tunisians appeared happy to play for a draw.Sundowns defender Bangaly Soumahoro conceded a late penalty and Esperance took advantage.Othman Najjar, a member of Esperance's technical team, laughed it all off, saying he does not see Sundowns winning in North Africa. Mosimane was not impressed, which led to a heated exchange (see box).The 52-year-old described the defeat as a "learning curve" and said his players will have to be smart."We just let ourselves down hey, in a critical phase in the 89th minute. We committed a foul - I think it's a foul. [It's] really, really, unbelievable," he said."I'm not saying it was not a penalty, but they always put the leg there. You know the story."I told the guys that, 'you got to be smart'. You can never ever try to play the way you do in the PSL in the Champions League, especially against the North Africans," he said.Defender Motjeka Madisha picked up a knock and joins a growing injury list. Mosimane, however, is hopeful that some will return in time for the return leg on June 21 in Tunis.
