SuperSport United will open discussions with Danish club FC Randers with the aim of keeping Mandla Masango permanently.Masango spent the second half of the Absa Premiership season on loan at Matsatsantsa from Randers and made 17 appearances in all domestic competitions for the club, scoring four goals.The 27-year-old was brought back by his former coach at Kaizer Chiefs, Stuart Baxter, but it seems SuperSport are keen on keeping him despite the departure of their coach to Bafana Bafana.Masango still has a year to run on his three-year contract with the Danish club.SuperSport chief executive Stan Matthews said they are interested in keeping the winger but that it depended on the fee they would have to pay Randers for the player."We can't decide to keep him. We have to talk to his club, which we will do after the Nedbank Cup final [against Orlando Pirates on June 24]."We would like to keep him but it's all finance dependent," Matthews added.Masango's career at Randers started well and he was named the supporters' player of the season in his first campaign. Masango, however, spend the second season on the sidelines as he turned into a fringe player after a dispute with Randers over their reluctance to sell him.This was after Randers had turned down an offer for the midfielder from one of Denmark's top clubs, Aalborg.
