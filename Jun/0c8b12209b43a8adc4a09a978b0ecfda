Kgoloko Thobejane may have helped Baroka FC escape relegation a few days ago but his future at the club now appears to be hanging by a thread.Asked whether he will still be with the Limpopo outfit next season the usually forthright 46 year-old mentor said he could not confirm with absolute certainty where he will be in the coming campaign. 'We are challenging for the PSL and the Caf title,' says Baroka coach Thobejane after escaping axe "I won't say anything about my future at the club. I don t know what the future holds for me please speak to (club spokesman) Jimmy Ngobeni " he said on Monday.Ngobeni was also very cryptic and he told TimesLive that the club's management and technical team would meet in two weeks time to discuss a host of issues including the coach's future. Chiefs paying their goalie R5000 "We cannot say anything about the future of the coach (Kgoloko Thobejane) at the moment Ngobeni said."The coach has done well to keep us (Baroka) in the PSL and then we will get back into his technical report in the next two weeks."And after going through the report we will assess his performance and we will then decide whether to keep him or not."Ngobeni confirmed that some players will be released by the club ahead of the 2017/18 PSL season."We will start with the release of the players we deem surplus to requirements."After going through the technical report written under the leadership of the head coach some players are definitely going to be released " he said.Ngobeni's statement contradicts Thobejane as the eccentric mentor told TimesLIVE on Sunday that he would resist the urge to dip into the transfer market. 'You can t have a goalkeeper who is going to chuck balls into his own goal,' says Pirates legend Gavin Lane He said he would make minimal changes to his squad next season."Sometimes as a coach you must not get yourself into this thing of signing signing and signing everyone " Thobejane said on Sunday."If they (club management) involves you you can tell them."If they don't involve you and come with a player then I look at him."But now one two or three players are enough for Baroka."We have a brilliant squad and we don't want to change anything." - TimesLIVE
