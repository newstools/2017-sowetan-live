After watching this year's Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) from their couches, Bafana Bafana players are eager to make a return to the 2019 edition in Cameroon.It's a new era for Bafana following the sacking of Shakes Mashaba last year and the recent appointment of Stuart Baxter.The new coach welcomed his players into camp yesterday to start preparing for the 2019 Afcon qualifier against Nigeria at Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo on Saturday.Having already replaced injured Dutch-based midfielder Kamohelo Mokotjo with Lebogang Phiri, Baxter looks set to be without Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana due to injury too.Kekana has a thigh strain and will need to be checked by the Bafana medical team, but he is likely to be replaced."Maybe I will be back in a week, but I have to check with the doctor [in the national team]," said Kekana. He has missed Sundowns' past two games.Kekana's former teammate at Sundowns, Ramahlwe Mphahlele, stressed the importance of starting well in the qualifiers. "We have a good team that's capable of going to Nigeria and getting a good result. You don't want to start [the qualifying campaign] on the back foot and rely on people to win games for you," said Mphahlele."We are going away and I am sure the coach has his plan figured out. Having looked at the teams he has coached, I am looking forward to working with him."SuperSport United players - Ronwen Williams and Dean Furman - will join the team once they return from Lubumbashi, after playing TP Mazembe in the CAF Confederation Cup yesterday.Bafana will train at Orlando Stadium today and tomorrow, leavingfor Nigeria on Wednesday.
