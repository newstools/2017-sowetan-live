Principals of KwaZulu-Natal schools with a 0% matric pass rate could be axed as part of the Department of Education s performance improvement strategy.This revelation was contained in a response to questions posed to the Department by the Democratic Alliance in the provincial legislature. The firing of under-performing headmasters would be the last move in a series of interventions undertaken by the education department. The Department had to carefully analyse the situation in each affected school and the conclusion was that it would be premature to dismiss any of the affected principals. In some instances principals did demonstrate weak leadership and management skills these were not the only contributing factors [to the 0% matric pass rate]. The department has since embarked on a process of rolling out an overall performance improvement strategy. Should these targeted interventions fail to bear fruit the department will consider dismissals their response read. DA education spokesperson Rishigen Viranna welcomed the announcement saying the move was in response to pressure from the opposition party. The move comes after months of pressure by the DA for action to be taken. During the past two academic years 19 schools in the province recorded a 0% matric pass rate he said. The DA sincerely hopes that it is not merely an empty threat. We can only assume that the MEC has finally realised the severe effect that poor leadership has on our schools and the long-term impact that this has on teaching and learning Viranna added.
