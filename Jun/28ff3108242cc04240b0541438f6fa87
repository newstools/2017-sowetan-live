For someone who had just declared the door shut on the prickly matter of 2016, Springbok forwards coach Matt Proudfoot did a pretty good job rolling out the welcome mat.About last year - is the least acknowledged question in the Bok ranks, especially with cameras and microphones in close proximity, but after a bit of prodding Proudfoot wade in yesterday."That door is closed. Sorry, I can't answer that question," he offered initial resistance."I'd say a lot of good came out of last year in the sense that no lesson is a bad lesson, and we have taken those priceless lessons on board," said Proudfoot yesterday, still basking in South Africa's series clinching win over France in Durban."If we think about where we were last year, we've created an environment where players can grow and thrive. We've come a long way."The Springboks and their crimes of 2016 have been indivisible in the build-up to this series. Naturally, scapegoats find it hard to shake cross hairs and Proudfoot felt duty bound to step into the breach for under fire Tendai Mtawarira in the build up to the series. Mtawarira, to his credit, responded with a fired up, near frenzied performance in Durban."To say a guy with 90 caps is past it is crazy, in my opinion," said Proudfoot."Coenie (Oosthuizen) is probably our next most experienced front rower."He (Mtawarira) has been incredible. If you talk to any of the props around the squad (they'll tell you) he's been great."Proudfoot also gushed about the input of props Thomas du Toit, Ox Nch and Wilco Louw."The guys have been contributing right through. In our first week in Joburg you had Coenie and Ruan (Dreyer) talking about binding positions."That stems from an appetite for the collective to be successful, that's up to them, not me."In the build up to Saturday's third Test the hosts will need no reminding that the last time France played at Ellis Park, they outscrummed the Boks. Powerhouse loosehead Jean-Jacques Crenca left an indelible blot on Etienne Fynn's debut and the Boks crashed 32-23.
