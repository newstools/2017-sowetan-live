Home buyers over the age of 50 are paying twice as much for their homes than buyers under the age of 30, according to the latest property market statistics from BetterLife Home Loans.However, they are only paying about 30% more on their monthly bond repayments.The BetterLife figures show the average home purchase price paid by buyers aged between 20 and 30 over the past 12 months was R772000, while that paid by buyers aged 50 to 60 was R1337000 - and that paid by buyers over 60 was R1687000."However, there is a much narrower gap when it comes to the home loans obtained by buyers in these different age groups," said Shaun Rademeyer, CEO of BetterLife Home Loans"Our statistics show that buyers aged 20 to 30 are currently paying an average deposit of around R90000, which puts their average bond at R682000 and their average monthly repayment at just over R6800.Most buyers over 50 are repeat buyers, he said, and these figures clearly illustrate the greater buying power that results from building up equity in a property which can then be used as a deposit to acquire a more expensive property, without raising monthly home loan repayment too much."Our stats also reflect this, in the rising percentages of home loans that are being granted in higher-price categories. In the 12 months to end-May, 38.7% of all homes loans granted were for more than R1-million, compared to 36.5% in the previous 12 months."Rademeyer said younger buyers were starting to struggle to get on to the first rung of the property ladder.Banks were becoming increasingly cautious when approving new loans and were applying strict credit qualification criteria."The percentage of home loan applications being made by first-time buyers has actually increased over the past 12 months from 46.1% to 47.5%."
