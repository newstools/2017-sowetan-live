Some members of the National Health, Education and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) ridiculed President Jacob Zuma yesterday, singing songs calling for Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to rescue them from a "shower man".The song was a reference to Zuma who told the High Court in Johannesburg during his rape trial in 2006 that he took a shower after having unprotected sex with an HIV-positive woman. Zuma was found not guilty of the charge.Nehawu was the first Cosatu affiliate to call for Zuma to step down. As Ramaphosa entered the venue, delegates ululated and sang: "Leadership, dumela."Ramaphosa said this was the moment of speaking out against complacency. He reiterated that South Africans needed leaders who are not captured."We must get rid of bad tendencies that have dogged our movement. Let us go and strengthen the ANC and make it stronger."This was said as Zuma loyalists Public and Service Administration Minister Faith Muthambi and Cosatu president S'dumo Dlamini looked on.Giving Ramaphosa a colourful fleece blanket, Nehawu's Nyameka Macanda said the union would always be behind him. In response, Ramaphosa said he was glad the blanket almost had ANC colours. "My wife and I will be very warm this winter," he said jokingly.Nehawu in its secretariat report says the corporate capture network around the Gupta family has become increasingly clear. "Big money is playing [an] active role . towards [the] 54th ANC national conference, with [the] so-called Premier League openly emerging as a faction rallying around cde [comrade] Jacob Zuma."
