Aubrey "Postman" Modiba does not want South Africans to only talk about how well Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates have done in the CAF club competitions.The left-back wants the name of SuperSport United to be in the mix as well.Matsatsantsa are determined to make their mark on the competition and they've no doubt sent out a strong message to opponents after coming from two goals down against reigning Confederation Cup champions TP Mazembe in Lubumbashi to earn a 2-2 draw on Sunday.They remain unbeaten in Group D, currently on top of the table on five points, level with both Mazembe and Horoya from Guinea.The former SA champions are slowly becoming potential candidates to win the continental club competition, but they need to improve at the back because they've conceded seven goals in their three group matches thus far."As a team I think we did well. We showed fighting spirit and we got a point away from home, against a top team like Mazembe."It showed that we worked for each other. We would have liked to win, but a draw is still a good result for us. We need to stop conceding and I believe we can go far in this competition," said Modiba, who reduced the two-goal deficit with a cool finish just before the hour mark."When I controlled the ball, I saw the goalkeeper coming towards me and I put it in the corner. It came at the right time. It would have been difficult to come back in the second half. It was an important goal. I have been working on my finishing."The success of both Pirates and Sundowns on the continent would have no doubt inspired Matsatsantsa.It's encouraging to see them playing so well in a competition many do not quite take seriously as they do the Champions League."We should show that it's not only about Pirates and Sundowns, but SuperSport as well. We want to go as far as possible."United host Mazembe in Atteridgeville on June 20.
