Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane feels departing midfielder Teko Modise has earned the right to be called a legend.Modise's contract with Sundowns ends tomorrow and he has decided to leave - a decision Mosimane respects - after spending six-and-a-half years with the reigning African champions."Yes for sure [he is a legend]. He's won footballer of the year, he played in the [Fifa] Confederations Cup and the World Cup. I mean there's nothing bigger than that," said Mosimane, who also worked with Modise at SuperSport United and Bafana Bafana.'Cursed' Teko bows out of Downs as a real legend"He has achieved everything. He won the league twice with us, he won the Telkom [Knockout], he won the Nedbank Cup. He has won big cups with me, the ones some players retire without ever winning. There's the Champions League and [CAF] Super Cup. Those are the grand slams. One day he can bow out and say 'I have contributed to football'."Mosimane believes Modise still has a lot to offer and the club he joins will benefit from the experience he brings."We have to respect his feelings. I think we should look at the positives. He has served us well and he has contributed to the team. We part ways amicably."He wants more game [time] and I am not going to lie to you and say I will give him more game time. He's still good as a player, but you can't promise so much. Surprise [Moriri] wanted game time and he got it at Highlands Park."
