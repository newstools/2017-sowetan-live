He s coming in the morning (on Thursday) Hunt said of the forward with 11 caps for Bafana.Hunt said Claasen is likely to sign for Wits barring complications. For me it s obviously agents. It s not like the old days where it s club to club. Today there s a lot involved. I mean that s football Hunt said.The coach is viewing Claasen as a forward replacement for Mogakolodi Ngele who along with striker Cuthbert Malajila has been recalled from a year s loan by Mamelodi Sundowns. I feel with Ngele going we need the pass. Every team needs that final ball and I think he can give us that Hunt said.Sangweni one of the country s best passers of the ball from defensive midfield is out of contract at Chippa United from Friday. Ja he s with us at the moment. But I mean I m not the one who dots Is and crosses Ts am I? Hunt said. Ja he s training with us. But at the moment they (the club and the player) are in negotiations. So I m not sure what s going down there. He came (on Wednesday). Apart from Malajila and Ngele Wits expect to keep the majority of their championship-winning squad intact this off-season with forward Jabulani Shongwe one of their few players likely to exit in the next few weeks.
