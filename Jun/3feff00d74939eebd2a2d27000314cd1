Siyanda Xulu will headline another Kaizer Chiefs clean-out this season, as Amakhosi confirmed yesterday they would be releasing seven players following a dismal campaign.Xulu was, in fact, also on the transfer list last season, but was retained after he could not find a team to join.He's on the list again, along with Siphelele Mthembu, Camaldine Abraw, Lucky Baloyi, Lewis Macha and Enocent Mkhabela.Zimbabwean striker Michelle Katsvairo will be loaned out."These players have contracts with the club but they did not enjoy sufficient game-time, and we felt it would be in their best interests as well as ours for them to pursue their careers elsewhere," football manager Bobby Motaung told the club's website.This is similar to last season when Amakhosi let go of players like Morgan Gould, Siboniso Gaxa, Bongani Ndulula and Ovidy Karuru with the hope that they would improve.Baloyi, meanwhile, expressed hope to find a new club to start pre-season training with." I am at home now spending time with my family. Something will come up," Baloyi said, adding his agent was working hard to secure a team.The Amakhosi product, who has previously been loaned out to Moroka Swallows, is linked with a move to Chippa United.Meanwhile, Chiefs yesterday confirmed the appointment of ex-captain Patrick Mabedi as assistant coach. He replaces the sacked John Paintsil.
