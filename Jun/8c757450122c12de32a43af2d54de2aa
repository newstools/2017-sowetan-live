It is almost safe to say Baroka have retained their Absa Premiership status after the Limpopo side registered their second victory of the promotion playoffs at the weekend.Bakgaga scored a 2-0 win over Stellenbosch at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.Goals from captain Olaleng Shaku (second minute) and Mduduzi Mdantsane (83rd) proved crucial for Baroka in their attempt to keep their top-flight spot.The victory for Bakgaga means Stellenbosch's dream of playing top-flight football next season is all but over after three matches, with only one game to spare.Nevertheless, that was not the only thing the win did for Baroka because now even a point in their last match will be enough for the Limpopo outfit to keep their premiership status next season.Winning two games in a row has helped Baroka who, in their last playoff clash, visit Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. Stellenbosch host Leopards at Athlone Stadium on Wednesday. If Leopards win in Cape Town and also collect maximum points at home against Baroka on Saturday, it could see the winner of the round-robin competition being determined by goal difference between Baroka and Leopards.Two wins for Lidoda Duvha would put them on seven points, equal to Bakgaga. The team with a better goal difference will play in premiership."I do not think Leopards will win the Limpopo derby. Their win will be a draw. We are ready for them. They know that they won't make it against us. We are the kings of Limpopo," boasted Baroka coach Kgoloko Thobejane.
