The call by ANC Youth League (ANCYL) leaders for former AU Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be the next ANC leader has divided the youth league.At the centre of divisions is the premature pronouncements on the ANC leadership race made by ANCYL president Collen Maine and secretary-general Njabulo Nzuza.The ANC has officially opened the succession debate, giving its structures the nod to start discussing names.The ANCYL goes to its national executive committee (NEC) meeting in Irene, outside Pretoria, this weekend deeply divided over who should be elected as the ANC leader in December.One faction wants Dlamini-Zuma to replace President Jacob Zuma while ANCYL NEC member Thembi Siweya said on Facebook at the weekend she supports Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa but admitted his name would not fly at the meeting.Maine said yesterday the ANCYL will make a formal pronouncement on the succession debate at the meeting."We can't control what people say or write on Facebook, but once a decision is taken it binds all of us as part of the collective," he said. "Nobody will speak contrary to that decision."He said there was a general agreement in the ANCYL that Dlamini-Zuma was the right candidate to replace Zuma.ANCYL Gauteng chairman Matome Chiloane said the province is supporting Dlamini-Zuma for the ANC presidency. However, the ANCYL West Rand chairman William Matsheke accused Chiloane of lying. "There has never been a formal discussion where a decision was taken to back [her]. Our position as the region is that Ramaphosa should become the next ANC president. We are consistent with the norms of the ANC that the deputy president succeeds the president."
