Even Kjell Jonevret could not say if he would be allowed to continue as Orlando Pirates coach following their unsurprisingly below par performance in Saturday's Nedbank Cup final.A wretched season during which Pirates ended outside the top eight for the first time in Premiership history concluded with a heavy, almost predictable 4-1 defeat to SuperSport United, who became the first team in three decades to defend this cup.It was a particularly chastening evening at Moses Mabhida Stadium for the Ghosts, who had seen their side plumb sorry depths this season and greeted the latest setback with pockets of hooliganism.The question now is whether Jonevret, having failed so dismally in the last five months, is the right man to lead Pirates.SuperSport thump Pirates 4-1 in Nedbank Cup final"Maybe this is not the right time to talk about that," the Swede said when asked if he thought he should continue."This was a poor ending to a tough season. I will have to sit down [with management] and present my report. Tonight was about the collective and we were very poor."Having joined Pirates in February, Jonevret is familiar with the complications associated with coaching the side.He conceded that signing new players was not solely his prerogative and hopes that Bucs management will listen to his input going forward.Baxter describes Letsholonyane 'fit as a butcher s dog'"We have problems. We have good players here and there, but if we have to be a top team again, we will have to acquire others. Unfortunately this is not like at Chelsea or Man United where you get exactly what you want to buy."Jonevret's tenure has fallen way short of expectations, with Pirates winning just two league games under him, and now humiliated in a one-sided final.Yet he feels his regime brought "positives"."We have stabilised a bit from when I started. We had lots of draws but we reached a cup final - that's a positive after a season we've had."The reality is that in 13 matches under Jonevret, Pirates beat only Maritzburg United and Chippa United, while their route to the final was paved with a relatively manageable programme.SuperSport was their first real challenge on Saturday - and Bucs failed it dismally.
