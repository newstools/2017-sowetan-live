The protesters accused them of shooting a teenager and started attacking them with sticks and stones," said Sabela.Koena, 45, who started working for the parastatal in 2011, was his family's breadwinner and leaves behind his wife Refiloe, 35, and three children aged five, seven, and 11 months. Koena's brother Edward said the family was looking for answers."Our understanding is that Joseph was based at Johannesburg's Park Station. We want to know why he was called in as a backup for the Nancefield security personnel."Why were there no SAPS and Johannesburg Metro police officers during the service delivery protest as is always the case?" asked Edward.Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed that they were investigating a case of murder.
