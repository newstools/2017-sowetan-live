Uber drivers operating around East Gate mall in Johannesburg on Tuesday staged a protest over alleged ongoing intimidation from meter taxi drivers.About 250 Uber operators are expected to deliver a memorandum to management at the shopping centre on Tuesday. Uber drivers have previously accused metered taxi drivers of damaging their cars and assaulting them while they operate in the area.Gauteng meter taxi drivers recently distanced themselves from a circulating message that threatened violence against Uber drivers. We are aware of a strike by Uber drivers to the management of the mall; it has nothing to do with us. As far as I am concerned I have no idea what the memorandum is about said Abner Mashikinya a Meter Taxi Association spokesperson.Uber SA spokesman Samantha Allenberg was not immediately available for comment.
