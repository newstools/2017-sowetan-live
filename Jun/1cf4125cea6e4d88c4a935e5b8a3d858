It was the perfect send-off for Stuart Baxter.Having insisted that he be allowed to coach SuperSport United in Saturday's Nedbank Cup final despite already taking over Bafana Bafana, Baxter led Matsatsantsa to a commanding 4-1 victory over an abject Orlando Pirates.Dismal run puts Kjell's future under spotlightWith that, he secured a third Nedbank Cup in four years, thanks to goals from Bradley Grobler (two), Jeremy Brockie and Kingston Nkhatha.A late penalty goal by Oupa Manyisa was scant consolation for the battered Pirates."I had been playing down the importance of this game, telling the players that it was not about me. that it was about turning a good season into a great one," Baxter said."We did well in that aspect and got silverware for the club. I'm grateful to the players for this committed performance. I can be satisfied with the send-off the club has given me."Pirates were in the game for only the first half hour, but from the moment a defensive mistake allowed Grobler to put United in the lead in the 32nd minute, there was no coming back for the Buccaneers.Baxter would like to be remembered as having earned his money at SuperSportThey looked terribly disjointed as Reneilwe Letsholonyane took full control of the midfield.Pirates' capitulation surprised even Baxter, because while he planned to win, he didn't expect it to be so easy."We knew that when we score a second goal, they would have had to come out and chase the game. This is a final and there's no point sitting back. I was a bit surprised with the little resistance we faced."They believed this is a final and they won't get three goals. They thought the game was over before we did."Baxter's mission at SuperSport is now complete as he hands over to Eric Tinkler next week, and there's no doubt the latter inherits a solid side capable of challenging for league honours next season.
