The Spanish doctor accused of murdering his twins will have to wait another month to know the outcome of his bail application.Mario-Cesar Dues Yela appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate s Court on Friday.Missing toxicology reports witness statements and forensic filings left the case file not anywhere near finalised according to state prosecutor Louise Freister Sampson.Defence attorney William Booth recommended that the full report be filed prior to the new hearing date of July 4. We don t even know what the cause of death is at this stage said Booth.Magistrate Goolam Bawa set a tentative date of June 23 for most of the papers to be filed.Dressed in a dirty black hooded top and jeans Yela leaned heavily against the stand and kept his head bowed throughout proceedings. His long hair covered his face and when prompted with questions Yela answered in a barely audible voice.The 48-year-old is accused of murdering his twin children and then confessing to his ex-wife.Yela had filed a motion in late April for bail because the hospital section at Pollsmoor prison had a negative mental and physical effect on him and there were fears that this could lead to suicidal tendencies. Booth noted that Yela had met with a private psychologist Dr Tuviah Zabow who would have a final psychological and emotional evaluation complete for the bail application.In the meantime Zabow and Booth would contact psychiatrists at Pollsmoor to better accommodate Yela.
