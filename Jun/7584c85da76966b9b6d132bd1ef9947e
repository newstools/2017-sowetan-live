South African Communist Party deputy chairperson Thulas Nxesi says corruption within the African National Congress-led government is occurring at both local and national level which is having a huge crippling effect on the unity of the party. The ANC has been denied by us and when you look at the problems these problems are not only at the national level. Just go and look what s going on in the local state at municipalities that s where corruption is glaring that s the face of it. Comrades what we must be careful of is that there will be contradictions some are positive and some are negative amongst ourselves. There will be those contradictions as we are analysing the situation. We must not be denialists nor cowards or even be reckless in how we deal with the situation. Denialist is denying what we see it s a reality that this thing is costing us in our revolution. Who is going to suffer? asked NxesiHe was giving a declaration on behalf of the SACP at the closing session of the Congress of South African Trade Unions 6th central committee meeting at Irene Pretoria on Thursday.Nxesi has previously blamed the ANC s poor showing in the local government elections on factionalism and corruption within the party. The ANC lost the Tshwane Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth metros.There are also fears that the ANC risks losing power in the 2019 general elections. Nxesi who is also Minister of Sport said last year s local government elections should have been a wakeup call for the ANC but it seems that the situation is getting worse. If you look at the events which happened after the local elections you would have thought that we would be scared and start to do things better but it seems as if we are continuing to slide down he added.Nxesi stated that the abuse of state institutions to settle political scores started a long time ago and should be condemned.
