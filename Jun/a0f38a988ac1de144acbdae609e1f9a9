SuperSport United are determined to send out a strong message in the CAF Confederation Cup by getting good results in their back-to-back group matches against defending champions TP Mazembe.Group C leaders SuperSport will face their biggest test yet in the competition in Lubumbashi on Sunday (2.30pm), against a Mazembe side that has welcomed Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns to their home ground in recent years.Mazembe beat Pirates 1-0 in Lubumbashi during the 2013 Champions League qualifying phase, but the DRC giants were knocked out on aggregate.In 2015, Mazembe hammered Sundowns 3-1 in the same competition, winning the tie 3-2 on aggregate to progress to the final round of qualifying.SuperSport caretaker coach Kaitano Tembo is aware that they have a mountain to climb, but he feels they are well prepared to face the defending champions.They meet at Stade TP Mazembe on Sunday and in Atteridgeville on June 20."The players are excited to play this game, but we are calm at the same time because we know we have a job to do. We are playing the champions and it won't be easy," said Tembo.Not taking anything to chance, Tembo has done his homework on Mazembe, who are in second place in the group on three points, one behind Matsatsantsa."We have done our homework. We know they have good players like Rainford Kalaba, Adama Traore, Tresor Mputu and Nathan Sinkala."In their past two games in the group they have scored their goals from crosses. They have skilful wide players and that's their strength."[But] They have weaknesses too. They are slow in defence."Matsatsantsa will be without Michael Boxall, who has joined the New Zealand national team ahead of the Fifa Confederations Cup, starting on June 17.
