It never rains it pours for declining soccer star Luyolo Nomandela.The former Mamelodi Sundowns winger has recently been dropped from his new team, Cape Town City, after just two appearances.Sowetan understands that things have been so tough for the player that he has been living off friends and has moved back home.Nomandela, 27, who is from Mthatha in Eastern Cape, remains clubless and according to a close friend has hit hard times and can't pay off small loans he takes from friends just to get by.Friend Mike Chaka told Sowetan that Nomandela, who was popular for hosting major drinking sprees at his luxury homes before moving to Cape Town, is a bad payer.Chaka, from Tembisa, said the star he has known for more than three years asked him for money last month."He just sent me a Whats- App last month and asked me to help him. He wanted me to borrow him money but I could only afford R500 so I sent that to him and he said he will pay me back month end."Chaka said he has not been able to get his money back and has since given up."I just let him be. He told me he doesn't have money so I let go. I am going to make that money soon but I worry about him because I hear he is dead broke now," Chaka added.Nomandela said: "I will pay him back. I didn't have the money but he will get it."
