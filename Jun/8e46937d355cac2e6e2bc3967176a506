Four of the five points Mamelodi Sundowns have collected in the CAF Champions League group stages have come away from home, so it's probably why they were so calm as they left OR Tambo International Airport yesterday.They began their journey to Addis Ababa - where they'll play Ethiopian outfit St George - eager to collect maximum points in their penultimate group match on Saturday (3pm SA time).A win for the reigning champions, who are in second place in Group C, would edge them closer to the quarterfinals and ease some pressure heading into the final group match against DRC side AS Vita in Atteridgeville next Friday.St George, in third place, are also on five points and cannot be taken lightly, if their gutsy performance in the goalless draw with Sundowns at Lucas Moripe Stadium last month is anything to go by."We are not in a difficult position. If we get a win, then we are in a good place. We need to go out there and do our best. We know what we need to do," said Sundowns forward Percy Tau."We do not underestimate them. They have international players in their team who play for Ethiopia, so they can surprise us."Khama Billiat and Wayne Arendse travelled with the team, but are both nursing ankle injuries.Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane said: "They are not ready. Khama is not going to play. He is doing rehab."Wayne has been training. He says he is pain free, but the ankle still feels funny. I think it needs to loosen up a bit because it's stiff. I don't think he will play, unless the doctors give me the green light. Maybe he will be on the bench."
