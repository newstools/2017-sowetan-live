The report amongst others directs the following remedial action at Parliament s Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services: The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services must initiate a process that will result in the amendment of section 224 of the Constitution in pursuit of improving socio-economic conditions of the citizens of the Republic by introducing a motion in terms of section 73(2) of the Constitution in the National Assembly and hereafter deal with the matter in terms of section 74(5) and (6) of the Constitution. The Public Protector s remedial action essentially instructs a committee of Parliament to start a legislative process prescribes to the institution on the policy that will inform the bill the wording of the amendment of the Constitution s section 224 and directs what constitutional provisions must inform the legislative process of the bill.Parliament believes that the remedial action which is binding in terms of the law usurps the powers of the institution under the Constitution. Section 57 of the Constitution empowers the Assembly to control its internal arrangements proceedings and procedures.Parliament will accordingly initiate a court application to have this remedial action set aside on the basis of its unconstitutionality.ISSUED BY THE PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
