Star jumper Luvo Manyonga endured a bittersweet weekend in Sweden where his victory at the Stockholm leg of the IAAF Diamond League confirmed his berth in the final of the lucrative one-day international series.Manyonga recorded a 8.36m leap in the Scandinavian city on Sunday, but he landed awkwardly on his final attempt.The 26-year-old will undergo a full scan on his hurt left leg upon his return from Sweden, his agent Lee-Roy Newton said in a statement yesterday."At this stage I will certainly hesitate to use the word injured," said Newton."I have spoken to him afterwards and although he is in slight pain I am confident that it is nothing serious."However, when he is back at Tuks/HPC [in Pretoria] he will definitely go for a scan just to make a 100% sure."I think we will have all the answers by [today]."Meanwhile, Caster Semenya is also assured of a spot in the final after she extended her lead in the 800m with her 1:57.59 victory in Norway on Thursday. The win increased her tally to 24 points."We are keeping our pace at 1:57 level, now it is more about the wins, than about the times," said Semenya.The finals are set for Zurich (August 24) and Brussels (September 1) where $50000 (R637 000) will be at stake for the champions.
