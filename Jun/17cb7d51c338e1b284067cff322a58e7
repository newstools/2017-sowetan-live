Not long after Mamelodi Sundowns checked in at OR Tambo International Airport yesterday for their trip to Ethiopia, Platinum Stars walked in ready to take on their long flight to Algeria.Stars are bottom of Group B in the CAF Confederation Cup without a victory in their four matches thus far.Mathematically, Dikwena can qualify for the quarterfinals but they cannot afford to drop any points, starting with the match against Algerian side MC Alger at Stade du 5 Juillet tomorrow (10pm SA time).Stars and Alger played to a 1-1 draw at Royal Bafokeng Stadium last month."We are looking to finish the group stages well. We want to go there and get maximum points. We have not registered a win yet, so we want to try get a positive result," said Stars' attacking midfielder Robert Ng'ambi.Dikwena must win their remaining two matches and hope Sfaxien lose theirs to stand a chance of advancing to the quarterfinals. But if anything, the journey has been a good experience for young players such as Katlego Khunou, 19, and Gift Links, 18."We have a lot of youngsters and this is a learning process for them. We have showed character to come this far. I am happy with how we have performed though we could have done better. We only take the positives from the tournament and hope that next time we do better," said Ng'ambi."The travelling is hectic, but this is what we are paid for, so we cannot complain about that." Willem Jackson will continue as caretaker coach tomorrow.
