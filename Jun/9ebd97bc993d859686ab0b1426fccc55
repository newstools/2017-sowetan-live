The South African Communist Party has condemned what it called the toughening of the illegal economic embargo against Cuba by the Trump administration.In what is seen as a part reversal of the US recent easing of the decades-old embargo against the Caribbean island state US President Donald Trump on Friday ordered tighter restrictions on Americans travelling to Cuba and a clampdown on US business dealings with its military.He said he was cancelling what he called former President Barack Obama s terrible and misguided deal with Havana. 'Trump under investigation for possible obstruction of justice' In a statement on Saturday the SACP said: The South African Communist Party has noted with contempt the hostile and misleading rhetoric by the US President Donald Trump directed at the people of Cuba their democratic national sovereignty and self-determination. ?The SACP condemns in the strongest terms possible the toughening of the illegal economic embargo against Cuba announced on Friday by the Trump regime of imperialist dictatorship during his foolish rhetoric and attack against Cuba. As the SACP we denounce the entire regime of oppression whereby one state extends the dictatorship of its ruling class and imposes it on another country. The SACP expresses its message of democratic solidarity with the people of Cuba. Our Party will strengthen and deepen its and working class fraternal ties with the lovely Cuban people. This includes intensifying the just programme for the US to unconditionally lift its regime change political-economic embargo against Cuba. ?
