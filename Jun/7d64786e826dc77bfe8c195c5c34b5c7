Caster Semenya will juggle her exams and race schedule in the next few days as she builds up for the IAAF World Championships in London in August.Fresh from her second IAAF Diamond League victory in Eugene, US, last weekend, the reigning Olympic champion will have spent at least two weeks at her base in Potchefstroom before she resumes her international track campaign next week."It's going to be hectic on the academic side because I have to sit for my exams. In fact, I'll be running in Oslo the same day I should be writing my other test but I'll catch up later," said Semenya of the Diamond League meeting in Norway on June 15."I'm left with one semester to complete my studies," said the final year sports science student at the University of North West.However, Semenya, 26, has enjoyed a free-flowing run on the track, riding on a long unbeaten streak in her specialist 800m event since her last defeat in September 2015."Running against good competitors over the last few months has really kept me on my toes. I don't have to lose momentum," she said in reference to her usual challengers Francince Niyonsaba of Burundi and Kenya's Margaret Wambui.The two finished behind Semenya on the Olympic Games podium last year and have trailed her at three other international events since.Semenya will compete at three more events next month before she winds down for the global championships.
