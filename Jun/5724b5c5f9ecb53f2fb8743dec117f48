The jaws of life had to be used to free a woman who was trapped inside a car after it crashed into a house in Durban on Friday morning. The car went down an embankment onto the roof of the house and landed in the garage section of the house. No one was injured in the house said KZN Emergency Rescue Services spokesman Robert McKenzie. One woman in her forties was trapped in the vehicle. She was extricated and taken to hospital in a stable condition. It was the second reported incident in just 12 hours in which vehicles had crashed into houses. In the first incident on Thursday evening in Inanda north of Durban three people died and 16 were injured when a taxi overturned.Crisis Medical spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said that the minibus had left the road and rolled repeatedly down an embankment. It came to rest against the side of a house. The minibus overturned and struck a house at the roadside. The cause of the crash is unknown and the driver seems to have lost control of the taxi while negotiating a bend he said. Those who were killed were flung from the wreckage as the taxi rolled and were found with no signs of life. He said that the injured minibus passengers were treated and stabilised at the scene and then transported by ambulance to medical facilities in the area.
