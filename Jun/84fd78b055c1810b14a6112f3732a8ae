Taxi owners and drivers converged on Emperor s Palace near OR Tambo International Airport in Kempton Park on Thursday in order to deliver demands to taxi finance provider SA Taxi.This after the disgruntled taxi council blockaded major Johannesburg freeways such as the N1 N3 and R21 highways in a bid to get their message across on Thursday causing a backlog of traffic and resulting in flights being delayed. We are here today to say enough is enough. We started in Durban and we are here in Johannesburg. We can t afford this payment as we are working for banks and for insurance houses and we and our families are struggling said Boy Zondi Santaco KwaZulu-Natal chairman and national deputy president. We can no longer afford 28% (interest on taxi finance deals) and we are saying today: SA Taxi Finance cannot carry on being rich while we get poorer. Government needs to come to the party we need a subsidy now because our drivers are losing work said Zondi.Santaco announced earlier this week that they would take to the street to protest against challenges dogging the industry.At least 1 000 taxis drove in a convoy interrupting traffic in and around Kempton Park east of Johannesburg.Thousands of commuters were left stranded and others were unable to go to work due to the strike.A representative from SA Taxi Finance is expected to respond to the taxi council s memorandum on Thursday.
