With so many central midfielders doing well locally and abroad, Lehlogonolo Masalesa is eager to use his opportunity in Bafana Bafana to convince coach Stuart Baxter to pick him regularly.Masalesa, who plays in Greece for AEL Larissa, is in camp with Bafana ahead of the team's participation in the Cosafa Cup, which kicked off in North West on Sunday.Masalesa last received a Bafana call-up when Pitso Mosimane was at the helm."I think now that there is a new coach, there's even more motivation to work hard and do well and get back into the Bafana fold."Even if it means playing in the Cosafa Cup, I do not mind. My team does not have a problem," said Masalesa, who made 14 appearances for Larissa after joining them in January.The former Orlando Pirates midfielder was impressed with how Bafana performed in the 2-0 victory over Nigeria in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Uyo earlier this month.The squad had overseas-based players such as Bongani Zungu, Keagan Dolly, Lebogang Phiri and Kermit Erasmus.Masalesa believes if more players move abroad and do well in European leagues, then Bafana will keep rising."The European leagues are at another level. I think the more players we have going overseas, the better our national team will be."The PSL is also improving with teams doing well in CAF [club] competitions. That's good for the country," Masalesa said.Masalesa will have a key role to play in the Bafana side, as he is one of the more experienced players in a young squad.South Africa will only enter the competition in the quarterfinals on Sunday, against the winner of Group A, which consists of Tanzania, Malawi, Mauritius and Angola.
