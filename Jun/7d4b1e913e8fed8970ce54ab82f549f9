Many people think that Bafana Bafana squad for the Cosafa Cup is made up of youngsters, but the national team's former captain Aaron "Mbazo" Mokoena has a different view.Though the squad has six of Amajita players who did duty at the Fifa Under-20 World Cup in South Korea last month, Mokoena has emphasised that coach Stuart Baxter should have given more younger players a chance."The mistake we do in this country is that we do not know what we mean when we say 'youngster'," Mokoena said."There are no youngsters in that Cosafa squad. For me, only a 17-year-old or younger player can be called a youngster. Baxter should have used the U-17s for this tournament."[Nevertheless], these boys will gain a valuable experience. The tournament will give Baxter a chance to identify players who will help the [senior] national team in the future."The under-20 players in the squad are: Thendo Mukumela of Mamelodi Sundowns, Sandile Mthethwa and Tercious Malepe (Orlando Pirates), Thabo Cele (Benfica, Portugal), winger Sibongakonke Mbatha (Bidvest Wits) and forward Liam Jordan (Sporting Lisbon, Portugal).Bafana have a bye and will enter the competition in the quarterfinals on Sunday, where they will clash with the winners of Group A (Angola, Mauritius, Malawi, Tanzania) at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium.
