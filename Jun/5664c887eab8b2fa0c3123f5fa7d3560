The worst-kept secret so far in South African football has been let out of the bag: Benni McCarthy has been unveiled as the new Cape Town City coach on a three-year deal. The former Ajax Amsterdam Porto Blackburn Rovers and West Ham striker has replaced Eric Tinkler who joined SuperSport United last week.
