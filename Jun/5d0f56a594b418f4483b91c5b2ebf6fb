Chamber of Mines office bearers met an ANC delegation on Tuesday afternoon to convey what they said were their perspectives on the challenges the new mining charter presents to the industry in terms of both the flawed process and content .

We need to continue on the industry s transformation journey that has been going on in earnest since the original charter came into effect more than 13 years ago.
