The Auditor-General has laid bare the financial performance of municipalities for the financial year 2015/16 revealing the good the bad and the ugly.City of Tshwane metro in Gauteng tops the list of the highest contributors to unauthorised expenditure blowing R1.914-billion from R786-million in 2014/15.The Auditor-General s report on local government audit outcomes released in Pretoria on Monday revealed that overspending 43% of which was related to non-cash items was the main source of the expenditure.Susan Booysen a Professor at the Wits University School of Governance said unauthorised expenditure was incurred due to unbudgeted-for events like natural disasters fires and storms.She however said the period under review 2015/16 was when the ruling party was campaigning for local elections so funds could have been diverted into showing people that government was working. To make an impression on voters that they are working but in general it is a serious concern and the national government has not been leading by example she said.According to the A-G s report the expenditure in Tshwane could mainly be attributed to employee-related costs debt impairment depreciation finance charges bulk purchases contracted services transfers and grants losses on the disposal of property and plant equipment.In February Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga said a major factor in the finances of the metro which they wrested from the ANC was the uncertainty regarding the outcome and financial impact of a number of legal cases in which the municipality was a defendant. He said these included a large number of labour or employment cases relating to suspensions and unfair dismissals expropriations and breaches of contracts with the potential liability estimated to be in excess of R226-million.Tshwane mayoral spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi said they did expect the unauthorised expenditure figure to be around R1.8-billion but said they have not seen the report. We have to get the report and be able to comment he said.
