Residents of a Limpopo village have accused a farmer of intimidation after he placed coffins along his fence.The information surfaced during a research mission by government officials in the Alldays area near Senwabarwana, ahead of premier Stan Mathabatha's visit to the area today.Sowetan has seen a video compiled by researchers revealing black residents complained to the authorities after coffins were erected a few months ago.This is not the first time a coffin had been used to intimidate. Two men were arrested last year after a video clip of them forcing Victor Mlotshwa into a coffin went viral after he was accused of trespassing.In the documentary style video about issues in Alldays, a police officer is seen explaining how the problem started when the farmer opened a case with the authorities after two of his lions were killed.The officer said suspects were arrested in connection with the killing of the lions, however, the farmer proceeded to erect coffins.He said the coffins resulted in complaints from locals who said they lived in fear."The meaning of those coffins could be threatening people that should they enter the farm, one will come out dead," the police officer stated.Also in the video, a man who lives in the area, said they felt that authorities were not doing enough to force the farmer to remove the coffins."If the community takes the law into their own hands to remove those coffins or we burn them, the police will come back to arrest the community," the man said.The video narrator also explained socioeconomic problems have pitted blacks and whites against each other."This has placed white farmers and African local people on a collision cause where they have even resorted to installing black coffin effigies as a warning against trespassing on their properties," the narrator said.Mathabatha is expected to visit the area to engage with residents about a number of other issues including a dilapidated police station, overcrowded schools and complaints that residents have to travel 90km to access a clinic.Addressing the media during the post provincial executive council meeting yesterday, provincial government spokesman Phuthi Seloba said they would assist the community to resolve the matter.Seloba said they would also attend to service delivery problems, but said the coffin issue could not be ignored because it was a matter of social cohesion."How do you subject your neighbours to such a thing," he asked.
