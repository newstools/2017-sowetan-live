Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter has called for better communication between the national team and clubs.Hi appeal came after a number of players reported for camp on Sunday with injuries which could affect his training programme.At the time of going to print yesterday, there were injury concerns with seven players, including Rivaldo Coetzee and Tokelo Rantie - who were due to go for scans on their respective knocks - ahead of Saturday's 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Nigeria in Uyo at 4pm.Hlompho Kekana and Kamohelo Mokotjo had already been replaced by Tiyani Mabunda and Lebogang Phiri respectively.But there could be more changes if some of the players do not make the progress Baxter and team doctor, Thulani Ngwenya, expect them to make.On top of the injuries that Coetzee (hamstring) and Rantie (swollen toe and right knee) are carrying, Baxter has to worry about the knocks to Lebogang Manyama (right knee), Andile Jali, Aubrey Ngoma (both groin) and Mabunda (ankle).Mulomowandau Mathoho, according to Ngwenya, has made good progress after he missed Kaizer Chiefs' last game of the season against Bidvest Wits due to a concussion."We expect that when they come [to Bafana] they are fit enough. The problem for me is I have a few [players] training and I would love to have all the players training properly. Not perfect, but we had a good meeting and the players are raring to go," said Baxter."I would like better communication and we are going to work towards that."Bafana trained at FNB Stadium yesterday and they will have two sessions at the same venue today. They leave for Nigeria tomorrow."When you have withdrawals, you have to respond. I am happy with the players who have come in. I am disappointed we lost key players, but that's part of the game," said Baxter, adding that he has done his homework on the Super Eagles."We respect Nigeria, but we are not going there to make up the numbers."
