Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has been reported to Parliament s Ethics Committee and the Public Protector for allegedly deliberately misleading Parliament.Zwane recently stated in a written Parliamentary reply that his December 2015 trip to Dubai was organised and paid for by the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR).Democratic Alliance MP James Lorimer on Wednesday said this clashed with information in the public domain about him being a passenger on a Gupta-sponsored flight to Dubai.Zwane never declared Gupta India trip DA reveals The Public Protector s State of Capture report found that Zwane had not used the ticket the DMR purchased for him to travel from Zurich to Dubai. The question is how did Zwane get to Dubai? asked Lorimer. Leaked Gupta emails list the Minister along with Tony Gupta as a passenger on a Gupta-sponsored flight that was cleared to fly to Dubai on 2 December 2015. Based on the replies he submitted to Parliament it appears that Zwane deliberately misled Parliament which is a breach of Section 7 (a) and (b) of the Powers Privilege and Immunities Act. The DA has submitted formal complaints to Parliament s Ethics Committee and the Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane.

In his response to the DA Minister Zwane stated that he has not met with any member nor close associate of the Guptas .

Furthermore the leaked Gupta emails show that the Minister was due to meet with Tony Gupta at the Guptas Saxonwold compound. Lorimer suggested that Zwane had been captured by the Gupta family.
