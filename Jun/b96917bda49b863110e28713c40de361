The Democratic Alliance wants Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to use a media conference she has scheduled for Monday to release numerous reports involving the Guptas which according to reports she has failed to do.DA spokesperson on justice and constitutional development Glynnis Breytenbach said that reports on Sunday detailed how Mkhwebane had for the last eight months failed to release at least four separate investigation reports involving the Gupta family.These reports include but may not be limited to:- The report of the investigation following a complaint laid by the DA into the illegal landing of Gupta wedding guests at the Waterkloof Air Force Base in 2013;- Numerous reports following investigations into the relationship and funding of Gupta media The New Age (TNA) and key state-owned companies such as the SABC as well as the North West provincial government; and- The relationship between certain ANC politicians and the Guptas.Breytenbach called on Mkhwebane to release these reports at her media conference scheduled for Monday in the interest of transparency and the South African public.She said it was telling that not one of the reports released by Mkhwebane during her tenure had involved any key political figures despite there being numerous complaints against such individuals. Given the flurry of reports uncovering just how far the ANC s project of state capture has reached it is more important than ever that the Public Protector investigate and report without fear or favour. The DA were concerned at her appointment and specifically that she has always been employed in and around government and that she specifically indicated that she wanted to have a more friendly relationship with government which now seems to be proving true. However Mkhwebane has an opportunity to act in the best interest of the South African public and release these reports at her press conference tomorrow and the DA strongly urge her to do so said Breytenbach.
