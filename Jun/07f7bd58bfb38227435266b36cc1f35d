Allister Coetzee says the nation's rugby lovers are starting to believe in the Springboks again after the horror of last year.The resurgent Boks have already won their three-match series against the French with a game to spare and Coetzee says this has helped restore the fans' belief in the team. People have belief in the Springboks again " Coetzee says."There were a lot of things that we said last year like there was no gold on the green anymore and stuff like that...."We are putting all that back now and you can see the reaction of the people."If you look at the number of supporters who attended (the first Test) in Pretoria we appreciate the love they showed the team."We would like to see that week in and week out. Last year's performances put Coetzee s job on the line and he says he understood he was being judged on the basis of the poor results. I have a four year contract with SA Rugby and a national coach knows that you are judged on a few things."I am pleased that the 2016 chapter is now closed."It is not to prove anything to anyone but our hard work is paying off at the moment."Mistakes were made but it is the ability to rectify (them) that counts and that is what is happening here."Eight months ago people booed us off the field in Durban and at the same stadium last weekend the players got a standing ovation."There is only one person s approval I ever wanted and that is the Almighty. - TimesLIVE
