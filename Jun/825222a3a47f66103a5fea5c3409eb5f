Injured long-jump star Luvo Manyonga will undergo a full scan on his return to his base at the high performance centre in Pretoria his agent Lee-Roy Newton said in a statement on Monday. Newton however is confident it s not too serious and that the Olympic silver medallist remains on track for the world championships in London in August.Manyonga landed awkwardly on his final attempt at the Diamond League meet in Stockholm on Sunday appearing to hurt his ankle. At this stage I will certainly hesitate to use the word injured said Newton a former sprinter. I have spoken to him afterwards and although he is in slight pain I am confident that it is nothing serious. However when he is back at Tuks/HPC he will definitely go for a scan just to make a 100% sure. I think we will have all the answers by Wednesday. Manyonga is the world s best long-jumper so far this year owning the four best leaps from 8.61m to 8.65m and with compatriot Ruswahl Samaai ranked No2 there is hope South Africa can win at least two medals in this event in two months time.
