They have spoken to Eymael and they are closely monitoring what is happening with him at Polokwane City " the insider said.Stars surprisingly parted ways with coach Cavin Johnson this week after the club decided not to renew a contract that was due to lapse at the end of the month.Krol is believed to be in the country but Stars face stiff competition from Cape Town City.City were still reeling on Thursday after Eric Tinkler dumped the club after only one year into a three-year contract to take over at SuperSport United.The frantic coaching activity has suddenly opened up a world of possibilities for Krol who has never hidden his desire to return to South African football."The issue with Krol may be a long shot but as you know anything is possible in football added the insider.Stars are expected to announce the new coach next Tuesday and he will be expected to hit the ground running as they have a Caf Confederations Cup clash against CS Sfaxien on 21 June at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium. - TMG Digital/TMG Sport
