Premier Soccer League champions Bidvest Wits have made Daylon Claasen their second acquisitions as they beef up the squad ahead of their Absa Premiership title defence and participation in the CAF Champions League. The 27-year-old joins the Clever Boys as a free agent after being released by Bundesliga II outfit TSV 1860 Munich where he spent the last few seasons. Claasen s arrival follows that of Free State Stars s defender Bokang Thlole who will join Gavin Hunt s team in July having signed a pre-contract in January.The coach is viewing Claasen who has seven Bafana Bafana caps as a like-for-like replacement for Mogakolodi Ngele who along with striker Cuthbert Malajila will return to Mamelodi Sundowns following a season-long loan spell in which they helped the Milpark club win their first league title in their 95-year-old history. Claasen was a star of the South African Under-20 team that reached the last-16 of the 2009 Fifa U-20 World Cup in Egypt alongside the likes of Andile Jali Kermit Erasmus Thulani Hlatswayo Kamohelo Mokotjo and Thulani Serero.
