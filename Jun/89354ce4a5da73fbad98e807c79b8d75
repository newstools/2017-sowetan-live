Strangulation could have been the cause of death of the late Eskom technician whose decomposed body was found at the utility's power station.An autopsy report reveals that Thembisile Lucia Yende, 30, had bruises on her neck. This has raised more questions for her family who were willing to accept the earlier assumption that she had taken her own life.Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele told Sowetan last night that Yende's body had injuries from the neck to the head."Her head had injuries and her neck had several bruises which shows that she could have been strangled and that will form part of our investigations. At this stage we don't know what could have killed her. No arrests have been made so far," said Makhubele.Police confirm Eskom employee Thembisile Yende was murderedHe said the initial case of an inquest they had been investigating has changed to murder in light of the autopsy report.Yende went missing on May 17 after she was last seen entering the Pieterboth substation in Springs, Ekurhuleni, where she worked as a technician. Police found her body lying on a plastic bag on the floor in her office 13 days later.Her cellphone and handbag were also found with her while her car was parked outside.Eskom had said that CCTV cameras were not working at the time of her disappearance although footage shows her arriving at work. This factor has led speculation her death was an inside job at Eskom.Family spokesman Mboneni Yende confirmed the autopsy report showed the deceased was strangled and suffocated."The thought of her being killed has shattered us. Initially, police suspected she had killed herself and . It would have given us closure knowing she had her own reasons to take her own life. We want to know who killed her and why."Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe could not be reached last night.
