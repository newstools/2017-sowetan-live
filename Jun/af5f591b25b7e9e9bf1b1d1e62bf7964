For a player who was supposedly "cursed" when he arrived at Mamelodi Sundowns six years ago, Teko Modise departed the club yesterday as one of its legends.But it's not the CAF Champions League medal which he won with the Brazilians last year that will serve as his major highlight at the club."It's that first trophy," Modise said of the 2013/14 Absa Premiership that Sundowns snatched from the jaws of Kaizer Chiefs to bring the first of Pitso Mosimane's six trophies - all of which Modise starred in.Trailing Chiefs by 11 points at one stage, Sundowns embarked on a remarkable run that saw them win 10 matches in succession to claim the title."That was my greatest achievement at Sundowns, to win a first trophy when people said I was cursed, that I would never win anything."Teko Modise and Mamelodi Sundowns part waysModise went on to add a second championship last year, as well as the Champions League, CAF Super Cup and the Nedbank Cup and Telkom Knockout winner's medals in 2015.It is for that reason that he felt the time has come to move on, having emphatically banished absurd claims that he was followed by bad luck. At 34, Modise feels he deserves more than the cameo appearances he made for Sundowns in the just-concluded season."I still have a passion to play, but I'm also realistic. I haven't played much in the last season and it's understandable because the team was doing well."I honestly want to go where I can play regularly because age is no longer on my side. I don't want to retire on the bench. People know Teko as a footballer, and that's what I want to be remembered as."Modise would not say where he's headed, but talk of him joining Cape Town City seems off the mark."I'm still absorbing the fact that I'm no longer a Sundowns player. If I were to start talking about my next destination, it would seem as if I've been talking to them in bad faith. The truth is they gave me my best years and I'll always be thankful for that."'I want hard work from everybody,' says new Cape Town City coach Benni McCarthy
