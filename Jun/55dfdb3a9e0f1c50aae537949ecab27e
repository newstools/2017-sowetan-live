His many critics will no doubt be rolling in the aisles but Baroka FC coach Kgoloko Thobejane maintains that he has now set his sights on winning the Caf Champions League and the domestic title next season.Thobejane is no stranger to proclaiming all manner of unrealistic expectations and after the club retained its Absa Premiership status following a 1-1 draw with Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday the former life orientation teacher at Mogodumo Primary School in Lebowakgomo was in his element."We are ready for the PSL preparations is as usual " he said on Sunday afternoon."We don't have anything special to say."This is our second season in the PSL."You can't avoid a situation in football . if you lose in football you have lost."Then if you find yourself in the relegation zone you must accept you are in the relegation zone."But what you must know is that whatever is there in PSL we are saying Baroka is there for it and we are challenging for the PSL and the Caf title.""We have a brilliant squad genius maybe one two or three players if the management deem it to say hey let s get one two or three. "Baroka escaped relegation after finishing the season second from the bottom and they then went into the three-team promotion/relegation playoffs with Leopards and Stellenbosch FC.But the scare does not seem to have bothered Thobejane too much and he has certainly not toned down his penchant for making outlandish predictions.He said on Sunday not only will Baroka challenge for the continental and domestic league titles he will pull off the feat while using the majority of the players who have just helped the Limpopo side survive relegation.The eccentric mentor said he would resist the urge to dip into the transfer market and will make minimal changes to his squad."Sometimes as a coach you must not get yourself into this thing of signing signing and signing everyone " he said."If they (club management) involves you you can tell them."If they don't involve you and come with a player then I look at him."But now one two or three players are enough for Baroka."We have a brilliant squad and we don't want to change anything."Thobejane said escaping relegation has confirmed his name in the PSL history books and he will continue to set records next season."Baroka will be in the PSL whether people want it or not."I don't need anything to say this thing can boost me as coach."I am ready whenever and ever I am ready."And I m not afraid of anyone in football."I m a different animal in football Kgoloko is a different animal."Baroka is here to stay 100 years to come whether Khurishi Mphahlele (cub chairman) or I will be dead or alive Baroka will be here." - TimesLIVE
