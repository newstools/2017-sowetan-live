Sebastian Vettel conceded that he was outpaced by the better man in qualifying, but insisted his Ferrari will have the pace to carry him to victory in Sunday s Canadian Grand Prix.Speaking to reporters after Hamilton s 65th career pole position equalling Ayrton Senna s total had put Mercedes at the front of the grid, the four-time champion German was adamant that he can still win the race.Vettel was fastest in Saturday morning s third and final free practice session, but was only second best in the afternoon when he was outpaced by three-tenths of a second. I think we always expected Mercedes to be very quick, especially in the last segment, Vettel said. Lewis did a better job today and he got a good lap. He was the better man today. I thought we could step it up and find a bit of time. I lost a bit into Turn Two, and then lost two-tenths out of the second corner and then I knew I had to catch up, which I did until the end of the lap. The car was very good and I was happy this morning so we should be good in the race. I think we have the pace to win. Vettel has 129 points after winning three of the six races in this year s championship and leads Hamilton by 25 points.
