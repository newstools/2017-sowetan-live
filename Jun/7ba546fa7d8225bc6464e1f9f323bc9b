Stuart Baxter paid a glowing tribute to Reneilwe Letsholonyane after SuperSport United beat Orlando Pirates 4-1 at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday to retain the Nedbank Cup. Baxter described Yeye as fit as a butcher s dog . Letsholonyane has been a key figure at SuperSport on and off the field this season. On the field he was the club s conductor, making them sing with his crisp passes and how he controlled the game. Off the field he leadership was key, helping a player like Teboho Mokoena to come out of his shell and grow among other things. The 35-year-old, who joined Matsatsantsa a Pitori at the start of the 2016/17 season from Kaizer Chiefs as a free agent, made the people who doubted him eat their words. I knew Yeye from Chiefs, Baxter said. I knew that he had a couple of years in him. He is as fit as a butcher s dog. He is sharp at training. If ever I was certain about a signing, it was Yeye. I gave him a massive hug when we came off the pitch and I told him to keep on winning things. Yeye will. He is a winner. "The best thing that happened to me was people saying that he is too old because then he was going to show them he isn t too old. He has had a magnificent season. He has been a tremendous signing. There were probably some people in the SuperSport board who had that thought in their mind, should we sign a big signing at that age. I told them that you won t regret signing Yeye. He has been a pleasure to work with and he has been a pleasure for the players to play with. - TimesLIVE
