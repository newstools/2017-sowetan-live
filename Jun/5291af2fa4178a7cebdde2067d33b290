The country's unemployment rate has been pushed to 27.7%, its highest in 14 years, largely because of the increase in the number of job seekers.Statistician-general Pali Lehohla announced that while jobs grew by 144000 over the last quarter, this was offset by 433000 new job seekers - "driving the unemployment rate to 27.7%".This had pushed the actual figure of unemployed South Africans of working age to 6.2-million. In a country with a labour force of 22.4-million, 16.2-million are employed.But the 27.7% was only the so-called official unemployment rate. The expanded unemployment rate, which includes those who did not look for work, stood at 36.4%.Lehohla released the Quarterly Labour Force Survey in Tshwane yesterday. He said of the 433000 who started seeking employment, 58% were youth between 15 and 34 years.Unemployed Umlazi man wins R34.4m in Lotto But unemployment remained the highest, standing at 54%. Youth enjoyed an absorption rate of 13% into the labour market.On the other hand, there were also disparities in the labour market based on gender."The unemployment rate for women is higher than that of males," said Lehohla.He added that more women were now seeking jobs, compared to the earlier days of democracy. "The overpouring of people, especially women, into the cities has been a phenomena post-1994 and gained momentum in 2002 [to] 2003."Citizens with education less than matric continued to bear the brunt of unemployment the most. Statistics showed that 33.1% of this cohort was unemployed. This was 5.4% higher than the 27.7% national unemployment rate.Unemployment among tertiary education graduates stood at a low 7.3%. But race dynamics came into play in employment amonth graduates. Only 17.6% of employed graduates were black, 13.3% coloured - while 48.8% were white and 39.6% Indian.Lehohla had previously stressed that SA desperately needed to increase the number of black Africans and coloureds obtaining university education.The 144000 growth in jobs was largely observed in manufacturing (62000), finance (49000) and mining (26000).Lehohla said mining recorded growth for the first time since the first quarter of last year."Employment grew in all provinces quarter on quarter except in Eastern Cape and Limpopo," said Lehohla.Johannesburg was among the metros that saw no growth.
