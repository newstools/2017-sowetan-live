Like many players in the Springboks setup over the past 12 months, Siya Kolisi was not guaranteed a place in the squad, let alone in the starting XV at any stage.But over the past 10 days that has changed and the explosive flank has nailed down his position in the Bok back row for the foreseeable future.Kolisi's performance in the second Test against France at King's Park was the best of his career at any level, and pleasingly also a continuation of a series of consistently high quality outings in 2017.He was immense against France, scoring a try, creating another, making several crucial turnovers and putting in a huge shift on defence as the Boks won 37-15 to clinch the three-Test series with a match to spare."That's the best I've ever felt after a Springbok match. Look, we work hard all week to improve our skills," was Kolisi's measured assessment of his performance."After and before training individual players do their own skills drills because that's an area we SA rugby players have been lacking in."- TMG Digital
