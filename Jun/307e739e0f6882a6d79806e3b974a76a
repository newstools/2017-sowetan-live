eNCA news channel has refused to provide details about the dismissal of its arts and entertainment reporter Nontobeko Sibisi.Sibisi made headlines last year after her story was pulled off air because she was allegedly wearying a doek.The story that allegedly got her into trouble with her bosses was about a cross-border music collaboration that featured Nigerian, Zimbabwean and South African musicians."For nine seconds of a three-minute piece, I appear wearing a doek and the story was taken off air without my knowledge."I was not spoken to, disciplined, e-mailed or reprimanded regarding this grave action. I was informed of this decision in passing by a subeditor," Sibisi said in a statement to Media 24 in 2016.Sibisi was dismissed on Wednesday night after a disciplinary process.The 24-hour news channel denied her dismissal was linked to the doek issue that happened in May last year.eNCA publicist Vasili Vass said in a statement: "That issue was resolved some months ago with the adoption and implementation of a new progressive policy developed with staff participation and agreement (including Nontobeko). Tweets linking her dismissal to the doek issue are not true."Keeping with company policy in matters of this nature, we will not comment on the reasons for her dismissal."TVSA reported Sibisi was ordered to leave the building immediately on Wednesday.Sibisi could not be reached for comment as her phones went unanswered.
