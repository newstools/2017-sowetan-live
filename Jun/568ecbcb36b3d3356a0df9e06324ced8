While former ANC Youth League leaders are pushing for younger leaders to take over positions in the party, provincial structures are pushing for their chairmen to be part of the organisation's top six.This comes as the ANC succession battle gains momentum ahead of the party's national elective conference scheduled for December.Some ANC provincial structures are not solidly behind the two clear frontrunners - deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and former African Union Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma - who are competing to succeed president Jacob Zuma.ANC Gauteng chairman Paul Mashatile has met with the organisation's Mpumalanga leader and premier, David Mabuza, to negotiate a consensus over the leadership slate. The ANC Gauteng, which is backing Ramaphosa to be the next ANC leader, wants to make sure that Mashatile is part of the party's top six after the conference.If this deal happens, the ANC in Gauteng would back Mabuza to be deputy president of the party - a move that is likely to anger the Zuma camp.There is also a twist to this because the ANCYL and Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans' Association (MKMVA), who are in the Zuma camp, have included Mabuza in their slate. The MKMVA wants Dlamini-Zuma to take over as ANC president.Mpumalanga provincial secretary Mandla Ndlovu told Sowetan yesterday that Mabuza would avail himself when nominations are officially opened."There are certain ANC structures that want Mabuza to serve as deputy president. We have accepted that call," Ndlovu said.Ndlovu said the ANC in Mpumalanga was not only negotiating with Gauteng."We are negotiating with all provinces. We want a negotiated leadership ."Mabuza is said not to be sure of who to support between Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma because the pair could ruin his campaign of uniting the ANC.ANC West Rand head of communications Mzi Khumalo said the region wanted Mabuza to be part of the team that will unite the party. The region backs Ramaphosa to be the next president.The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal is in a dilemma because it apparently has three candidates for the position of party leader - Dlamini-Zuma, treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize and Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe. ANC provincial spokesman Mdumiseni Ntuli admitted that the party was in an "untenable" situation.Ntuli said the province was "engaging other provinces without conditions".Limpopo and Free State are keeping their preferences close to their chests.The ANCYL in the Free State has announced ANC provincial chairman Ace Magashule as its preferred candidate for the position of secretary-general and backs Dlamini-Zuma for party president.The ANC in the Eastern Cape is pushing for the organisation's current secretary-general Gwede Mantashe to be included in the party's top six.
