 Voetzek zishimane screamed one of the posters at a picket outside the Durban offices of the Human Rights Commission on Friday.Loosely translated it means all men who are hopeless in courting women to f**k off. It is an indication of the anger of people over human trafficking and murder of women and and children. The protest was organised by trade union federation Cosatu. As Cosatu we said we can t keep quiet when something we regard as inhumane and against the spirit of ubuntu is happening in our country said Cosatu provincial secretary Edwin Mkhize. We can t fold our hands when there are these sporadic and brutal killings of our mothers and sisters the abuse of our children the human trafficking of women and children. He said Cosatu should be at the forefront of the campaign against the abuse and death of women and children abuse. We are making a call to the commission that what is happening is against human rights and that the institution must be found compelled to protect women and children Mkhize said.He also called for harsher sentences for those found guilty for killing and abusing women and children. About 50 protesters sang and danced outside the commissions s offices waving placards calling for an end to women and children abuse.
