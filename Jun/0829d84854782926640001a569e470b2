So far so good for travellers coming into and leaving the storm-lashed Mother City by plane.But everyone with a flight booking should stay in touch with their airlines throughout Wednesday as this could change.Deidre Davids spokesperson for the Airports Company South Africa said on Wednesday: Thankfully we haven t had any flights delayed or cancelled so far and all have been operating as per schedule. Your airline should have your direct contact details and should let you know if anything changes. Davids said the real danger was the trip to and from the airport. Although the roads to and from Cape Town International Airport are quieter today they are extremely wet. Please give yourself enough time to get there slowly. Don t do a last-minute rush thing. Worst is still to come forecasters warn storm-tossed Cape TownWhile the situation looked good soon after dawn if the weather gets worse we could be looking at flights being delayed or cancelled but we are hoping not .Davids urged everyone to be patient and tolerant if the weather had an impact on flights.On Tuesday Guy Leitch editor of SA Flyer magazine said on CapeTalk that all aircraft have very defined limits as to what cross-wind component and other winds they can tolerate and that on short-haul flights the decision is usually to the pilot .He added however that at a certain level of wind it transcends pilot decision-making and SAA s global operations command unit could then simply say we are cancelling or postponing [flights] .
