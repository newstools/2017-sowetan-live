Government departments and state-owned entities (SOEs) pay white and Indian advocates more money, although they employ more black advocates for civil cases.This is the finding of a survey conducted by the Law Society of South Africa (LSSA).It looked at the distribution of legal work from January 5 2015 to February 12 last year . It found that work was not distributed evenly among advocates, "but only a few receive most of the work most of the time".There was a "significant gap" between male and female advocates getting state work, "with the latter being at the bottom of those who get [it]".The report comes after a recent outcry about the slow pace of transformation of the legal industry.At SOEs, more black male advocates were appointed, followed by whites, with Indians in third place. But payments were unequal."In terms of payment, it depends on the nature and value of the work an individual advocate has received. White male senior advocates followed by Indian male senior advocates are the most [well] paid."The Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) enrolled the services of 11 white senior counsels and paid more than R1.7-million. No black senior counsels were enrolled.Acsa used 10 black junior counsels and paid them R368000, and roped in nine white junior counsels but paid them R859000. The five Indian senior counsels used made R885000. One coloured senior counsel was used and was paid R34200.The LSSA study said it was concerning that about eight white advocates and one black advocate were regulars on the list.At the special investigating unit, "most of the work goes to the same small pool of individuals, mostly black and white male advocates. Females of all races are excluded from receiving briefs, with the exception of black female junior advocates."At the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, the "work was distributed only to a white male advocate".Justice department spokesman Mthunzi Mhaga said: "I'm not privy to the latest statistics . The issue of briefing is very important to the minister [Michael Masutha]."He wants to ensure that the previously disadvantaged benefit."
